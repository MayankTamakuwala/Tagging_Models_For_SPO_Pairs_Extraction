Karolinska Development AB (Nasdaq Stockholm: KDEV) today announces that portfolio company PharmNovo received positive feedback regarding its most advanced drug candidate, PN6047, in a pre-IND meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The meeting aimed to provide guidance on the design of the company's planned Phase 2a clinical trial for the treatment of peripheral neuropathy and allodynia. PharmNovo conducted a regulatory pre-IND Type B meeting with the FDA in January 2025. Such meetings are typically held before submitting an Investigational New Drug (IND) application, which is required to conduct clinical studies in the U.S. During the meeting, PharmNovo presented preclinical data, sought advice on its Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC) activities, and received guidance on the design of its planned Phase 2a study for PN6047. FDA did not direct any negative remarks neither concerning the CMC information nor the preclinical data and provided useful guidance for the continued clinical development Based on the feedback, PharmNovo plans to apply for IND approval from FDA before the end of 2025. Furthermore, the company aims to apply for approval to initiate a clinical Phase 2a trial in Europe in the third quartal of 2025. PharmNovo’s most advanced drug candidate, PN6047, is a selective delta-opioid receptor agonist (DORA) being developed as a new treatment for complex pain conditions. ""Pain management is an area of significant commercial interest.

Coop Pank AS results for February 2025,"March 12, 2025 02:00 ET","Coop Pank’s financial results in February 2025: Comment by Paavo Truu, Member of the Management Board and CFO of Coop Pank: ""In February, the shortest month of the year, Coop Pank achieved solid business growth and strong profitability. Thanks to the increasing number of customers and actively transacting clients, the bank also grew its domestic deposit volume, allowing it to reduce reliance on deposits from international platforms. As term deposit interest rates are rapidly declining, private customers are showing growing interest in savings deposits. To meet this demand, Coop Pank offers the increasingly popular Rahasahtel savings account with a 2% interest rate and the Lastehoius children's savings account with a 3.1% interest rate. The bank’s loan portfolio also saw solid growth in February. While demand for leasing and consumer loans was modest at the beginning of the year, as expected, the declining Euribor has increased interest in business and home loans. In line with Coop Pank’s values and its commitment to supporting the development and well-being of Estonian society, in February, celebration of Estonia’s Independence Day, we introduced a special mortgage offer for police officers, rescue workers, and military personnel. Additionally, we gave customers the option to stop using physical bank cards and switch entirely to virtual cards. With this, Coop Pank became the second bank in Estonia to offer a more convenient and secure digital payment solution. Coop Pank continues on a steady growth path – over the past year, the bank’s customer base has grown by 13%, deposits by 12%, and the loan portfolio by 18%."" More detailed financial reports of Coop Pank are available at:  https://www.cooppank.ee/en/financial-reports Coop Pank, based on Estonian capital, is one of the five universal banks operating in Estonia. The number of clients using Coop Pank for their daily banking reached 211,000. Coop Pank aims to put the synergy generated by the interaction of retail business and banking to good use and to bring everyday banking services closer to people’s homes. The strategic shareholder of the bank is the domestic retail chain Coop Eesti, comprising of 320 stores.

"YieldMax™ ETFs Announces Distributions on SMCY (101.11%), MSTY (89.54%), AIYY (83.75%), ULTY (83.40%), LFGY (60.76%) and Others","March 12, 2025 06:55 ET","CHICAGO and MILWAUKEE and NEW YORK, March  12, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- YieldMax™ today announced distributions for the YieldMax™ Weekly Payers and Group D ETFs listed in the table below. Performance data quoted represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, when sold or redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost and current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted above. Performance current to the most recent month-end can be obtained by calling (833) 378-0717. Note: DIPS, FIAT, CRSH and YQQQ are hereinafter referred to as the “Short ETFs”. Distributions are not guaranteed. The Distribution Rate and 30-Day SEC Yield are not indicative of future distributions, if any, on the ETFs. In particular, future distributions on any ETF may differ significantly from its Distribution Rate or 30-Day SEC Yield. You are not guaranteed a distribution under the ETFs. Distributions for the ETFs (if any) are variable and may vary significantly from period to period and may be zero. Accordingly, the Distribution Rate and 30-Day SEC Yield will change over time, and such change may be significant. Investors in the Funds will not have rights to receive dividends or other distributions with respect to the underlying reference asset(s). *The inception date for RDTY is March 5, 2025. 1 All YieldMax™ ETFs shown in the table above (except YMAX, YMAG, FEAT, FIVY and ULTY) have a gross expense ratio of 0.99%. YMAX, YMAG and FEAT have a Management Fee of 0.29% and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses of 0.99% for a gross expense ratio of 1.28%. FIVY has a Management Fee of 0.29% and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses of 0.59% for a gross expense ratio of 0.88%. “Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses” are indirect fees and expenses that the Fund incurs from investing in the shares of other investment companies, namely other YieldMax™ ETFs. ULTY has a gross expense ratio after the fee waiver of 1.30%. The Advisor has agreed to a fee waiver of 0.10% through at least February 28, 2026. 2 The Distribution Rate shown is as of close on March 11, 2025. The Distribution Rate is the annual distribution rate an investor would receive if the most recent distribution, which includes option income, remained the same going forward. The Distribution Rate is calculated by annualizing an ETF’s Distribution per Share and dividing such annualized amount by the ETF’s most recent NAV. The Distribution Rate represents a single distribution from the ETF and does not represent its total return. Distributions may also include a combination of ordinary dividends, capital gain, and return of investor capital, which may decrease an ETF’s NAV and trading price over time. As a result, an investor may suffer significant losses to their investment. These Distribution Rates may be caused by unusually favorable market conditions and may not be sustainable. Such conditions may not continue to exist and there should be no expectation that this performance may be repeated in the future. 3 The 30-Day SEC Yield represents net investment income, which excludes option income, earned by such ETF over the 30-Day period ended February 28, 2025, expressed as an annual percentage rate based on such ETF’s share price at the end of the 30-Day period. 4 Each ETF’s strategy (except those of the Short ETFs) will cap potential gains if its reference asset’s shares increase in value, yet subjects an investor to all potential losses if the reference asset’s shares decrease in value. Such potential losses may not be offset by income received by the ETF. Each Short ETF’s strategy will cap potential gains if its reference asset decreases in value, yet subjects an investor to all potential losses if the reference asset increases in value. Such potential losses may not be offset by income received by the ETF. 5 ROC refers to Return of Capital. The ROC percentage is the portion of the distribution that represents an investor's original investment. Each Fund has a limited operating history and while each Fund's objective is to provide current income, there is no guarantee the Fund will make a distribution. Distributions are likely to vary greatly in amount. Standardized Performance For YMAX, click here. For YMAG, click here. For TSLY, click here. For OARK, click here. For APLY, click here.

Important Information This material must be preceded or accompanied by the prospectus. For all prospectuses, click here. Contact Gavin Filmore at gfilmore@tidalfg.com for more information. Tidal Financial Group is the adviser for all YieldMax™ ETFs. THE FUND, TRUST, AND ADVISER ARE NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY UNDERLYING REFERENCE ASSET. Risk Disclosures (applicable to all YieldMax ETFs referenced above, except the Short ETFs) YMAX, YMAG, FEAT and FIVY generally invest in other YieldMax™ ETFs. As such, these two Funds are subject to the risks listed in this section, which apply to all the YieldMax™ ETFs they may hold from time to time. Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Call Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s call writing strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in the positive price returns of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold call options and over longer periods. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared (“cleared derivatives”). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund’s counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house (“clearing members”) can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying instrument, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. A high portfolio turnover rate increases transaction costs, which may increase the Fund’s expenses. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of call option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in increases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Call Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, which focuses on an individual security (ARKK, TSLA, AAPL, NVDA, AMZN, META, GOOGL, NFLX, COIN, MSFT, DIS, XOM, JPM, AMD, PYPL, SQ, MRNA, AI, MSTR, Bitcoin ETP, GDX®, SNOW, ABNB, BABA, TSM, SMCI, PLTR, MARA, CVNA), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Indirect Investment Risk. The Index is not affiliated with the Trust, the Fund, the Adviser, or their respective affiliates and is not involved with this offering in any way. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to GPTY) Artificial Intelligence Risk. Issuers engaged in artificial intelligence typically have high research and capital expenditures and, as a result, their profitability can vary widely, if they are profitable at all. The space in which they are engaged is highly competitive and issuers’ products and services may become obsolete very quickly. These companies are heavily dependent on intellectual property rights and may be adversely affected by loss or impairment of those rights. The issuers are also subject to legal, regulatory and political changes that may have a large impact on their profitability. A failure in an issuer’s product or even questions about the safety of the product could be devastating to the issuer, especially if it is the marquee product of the issuer. It can be difficult to accurately capture what qualifies as an artificial intelligence company. Technology Sector Risk. The Fund will invest substantially in companies in the information technology sector, and therefore the performance of the Fund could be negatively impacted by events affecting this sector. Market or economic factors impacting technology companies and companies that rely heavily on technological advances could have a significant effect on the value of the Fund’s investments. The value of stocks of information technology companies and companies that rely heavily on technology is particularly vulnerable to rapid changes in technology product cycles, rapid product obsolescence, government regulation and competition, both domestically and internationally, including competition from foreign competitors with lower production costs. Stocks of information technology companies and companies that rely heavily on technology, especially those of smaller, less-seasoned companies, tend to be more volatile than the overall market. Information technology companies are heavily dependent on patent and intellectual property rights, the loss or impairment of which may adversely affect profitability. Risk Disclosure (applicable only to MARO) Digital Assets Risk: The Fund does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. The Fund does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. The Fund does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than the Fund. Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to BABO and TSMY) Currency Risk: Indirect exposure to foreign currencies subjects the Fund to the risk that currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar. Currency rates in foreign countries may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time for a number of reasons, including changes in interest rates and the imposition of currency controls or other political developments in the U.S. or abroad. Depositary Receipts Risk: The securities underlying BABO and TSMY are American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”). Investment in ADRs may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market. Foreign Market and Trading Risk: The trading markets for many foreign securities are not as active as U.S. markets and may have less governmental regulation and oversight. Foreign Securities Risk: Investments in securities of non-U.S. issuers involve certain risks that may not be present with investments in securities of U.S. issuers, such as risk of loss due to foreign currency fluctuations or to political or economic instability, as well as varying regulatory requirements applicable to investments in non-U.S. issuers. There may be less information publicly available about a non-U.S. issuer than a U.S. issuer. Non-U.S. issuers may also be subject to different regulatory, accounting, auditing, financial reporting and investor protection standards than U.S. issuers. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to GDXY) Risk of Investing in Foreign Securities. The Fund is exposed indirectly to the securities of foreign issuers selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. Investments in the securities of foreign issuers involve risks beyond those associated with investments in U.S. securities. Risk of Investing in Gold and Silver Mining Companies. The Fund is exposed indirectly to gold and silver mining companies selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. The Fund invests in options contracts based on the value of the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX®), which subjects the Fund to some of the same risks as if it owned GDX®, as well as the risks associated with Canadian, Australian and Emerging Market Issuers, and Small-and Medium-Capitalization companies. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YBIT) YBIT does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than YBIT. Bitcoin Investment Risk: The Fund’s indirect investment in Bitcoin, through holdings in one or more Underlying ETPs, exposes it to the unique risks of this emerging innovation. Bitcoin’s price is highly volatile, and its market is influenced by the changing Bitcoin network, fluctuating acceptance levels, and unpredictable usage trends. Digital Assets Risk: Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility. Potentially No 1940 Act Protections. As of the date of this Prospectus, there is only a single eligible Underlying ETP, and it is an investment company subject to the 1940 Act. Bitcoin ETP Risk: The Fund invests in options contracts that are based on the value of the Bitcoin ETP. This subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it owned shares of the Bitcoin ETP, even though it does not. Bitcoin ETPs are subject, but not limited, to significant risk and heightened volatility. An investor in a Bitcoin ETP may lose their entire investment. Bitcoin ETPs are not suitable for all investors. In addition, not all Bitcoin ETPs are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Those Bitcoin ETPs that are not registered under such statute are therefore not subject to the same regulations as exchange traded products that are so registered. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to the Short ETFs) Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Price Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the value of the underlying reference asset. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the underlying reference asset, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, the Fund is subject to the risk that the value of the underlying reference asset increases. If the value of the underlying reference asset increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. Put Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s put writing (selling) strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in decreases in the value of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold put options and over longer periods. Purchased OTM Call Options Risk. The Fund’s strategy is subject to potential losses if the underlying reference asset increases in value, which may not be offset by the purchase of out-of-the-money (OTM) call options. The Fund purchases OTM calls to seek to manage (cap) the Fund’s potential losses from the Fund’s short exposure to the underlying reference asset if it appreciates significantly in value. However, the OTM call options will cap the Fund’s losses only to the extent that the value of the underlying reference asset increases to a level that is at or above the strike level of the purchased OTM call options. Any increase in the value of the underlying reference asset to a level that is below the strike level of the purchased OTM call options will result in a corresponding loss for the Fund. For example, if the OTM call options have a strike level that is approximately 100% above the then-current value of the underlying reference asset at the time of the call option purchase, and the value of the underlying reference asset increases by at least 100% during the term of the purchased OTM call options, the Fund will lose all its value. Since the Fund bears the costs of purchasing the OTM calls, such costs will decrease the Fund’s value and/or any income otherwise generated by the Fund’s investment strategy. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared (""cleared derivatives""). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund's counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house (""clearing members"") can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in decreases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Put Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, for any Fund that focuses on an individual security (e.g., TSLA, COIN, NVDA), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YQQQ) Index Overview. The Nasdaq 100 Index is a benchmark index that includes 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, based on market capitalization. Index Level Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the Index level. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the Index, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the Index level, the Fund is subject to the risk that the Index level increases. If the Index level increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. The Fund may also be subject to the following risks: innovation and technological advancement; strong market presence of Index constituent companies; adaptability to global market trends; and resilience and recovery potential. Index Level Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will benefit from decreases in the Index level experienced over the Put Period. This means that if the Index level experiences a decrease in value below the strike level of the sold put options during a Put Period, the Fund will likely not experience that increase to the same extent and any Fund gains may significantly differ from the level of the Index losses over the Put Period. Additionally, because the Fund is limited in the degree to which it will participate in decreases in value experienced by the Index level over each Put Period, but has significant negative exposure to any increases in value experienced by the Index level over the Put Period, the NAV of the Fund may decrease over any given period. The Fund’s NAV is dependent on the value of each options portfolio, which is based principally upon the inverse of the performance of the Index level. The Fund’s ability to benefit from the Index level decreases will depend on prevailing market conditions, especially market volatility, at the time the Fund enters into the sold put option contracts and will vary from Put Period to Put Period. The value of the options contracts is affected by changes in the value and dividend rates of component companies that comprise the Index, changes in interest rates, changes in the actual or perceived volatility of the Index and the remaining time to the options’ expiration, as well as trading conditions in the options market. As the Index level changes and time moves towards the expiration of each Put Period, the value of the options contracts, and therefore the Fund’s NAV, will change. However, it is not expected for the Fund’s NAV to directly inversely correlate on a day-to-day basis with the returns of the Index level. The amount of time remaining until the options contract’s expiration date affects the impact that the value of the options contracts has on the Fund’s NAV, which may not be in full effect until the expiration date of the Fund’s options contracts. Therefore, while changes in the Index level will result in changes to the Fund’s NAV, the Fund generally anticipates that the rate of change in the Fund’s NAV will be different than the inverse of the changes experienced by the Index level.

THSYU Unveils Next-Generation Security: Redefining Trust in Crypto Trading,"March 12, 2025 05:43 ET","DENVER, March  12, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- THSYU, a pioneer in the cryptocurrency trading ecosystem, has unveiled a series of groundbreaking security enhancements, setting a new benchmark for asset protection and user trust. By integrating quantum-resistant encryption, AI-driven threat detection, and a reinforced multilayer security framework, THSYU is redefining the security and reliability of digital asset exchanges for its global user base, with a special focus on the French market.  THSYU: A New Standard in SecurityAt the core of THSYU’s security architecture is its pioneering adoption of quantum-resistant encryption, a forward-thinking measure that safeguards user assets against future threats posed by quantum computing. Unlike traditional cryptographic systems, this approach ensures long-term resilience, positioning THSYU as a leader in an industry where security is paramount. This technology, paired with a multi-signature authorization system, requires multiple independent verifications for every transaction, dramatically reducing the risks of unauthorized access or internal breaches. THSYU’s commitment to transparency and reliability is further demonstrated through its rigorous smart contract auditing process. Leveraging advanced AI tools and third-party expertise, the platform conducts continuous audits to eliminate vulnerabilities in its self-executing contracts. This proactive approach ensures that every transaction on THSYU is secure, seamless, and tamper-proof, providing users with unmatched peace of mind. AI-Powered Protection and Real-Time ResilienceWhat sets THSYU apart is its AI-driven threat detection system, capable of analyzing millions of data points in real time. This system identifies and neutralizes potential risks—whether from sophisticated cyberattacks, insider threats, or irregular trading behavior—before they can impact users. Coupled with a dynamic anomaly response protocol, THSYU ensures swift action to mitigate any emerging security challenges, making it one of the most responsive platforms in the market. To address the volatility of crypto trading, THSYU has also implemented a cloud-based infrastructure with adaptive scaling capabilities. This ensures uninterrupted performance during high-traffic periods, such as market surges, while maintaining top-tier security standards. Whether users are trading Bitcoin, Ethereum, or emerging altcoins, THSYU delivers a stable and secure experience every time. A Vision for the Future of Crypto Trading“Security is not just a feature; it’s the foundation of trust,” said Alexandre Johnson, CEO of THSYU. “Our mission is to provide users, particularly in France and worldwide, with a platform that meets today’s demands while anticipating tomorrow’s challenges. With these innovations, THSYU is raising the bar for what a cryptocurrency exchange can achieve.” As the cryptocurrency market continues to grow rapidly, THSYU remains steadfast in its commitment to user protection, regulatory compliance, and technological excellence. Industry analysts predict that THSYU’s bold advancements will not only attract a growing base of retail and institutional traders in France but also push competitors to rethink their own security strategies.

"Manhattan Bridge Capital, Inc. Reports Results for 2024","March 12, 2025 07:05 ET","GREAT NECK, N.Y., March  12, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Manhattan Bridge Capital, Inc. (Nasdaq: LOAN) (the “Company”) announced today that net income for the year ended December 31, 2024 was approximately $5,591,000, or $0.49 per share (based on approximately 11.4 million weighted-average outstanding common shares), versus approximately $5,476,000, or $0.48 per share (based on approximately 11.5 million weighted-average outstanding common shares) for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $115,000, or 2.1%. This increase is primarily attributable to a decrease in interest expense, partially offset by a decrease in origination fees. Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024, was approximately $9,689,000, compared to approximately $9,796,000 for the year ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of $107,000, or 1.1%. The decrease in revenue was due to a reduction in loans receivable, period over period, and reduced origination fees, which were impacted by a slowdown in new loan originations, partially offset by higher interest rates charged on the Company’s commercial loans. In 2024, approximately $8,047,000 of the Company’s revenue represents interest income on secured, real estate loans that the Company offers to real estate investors, compared to approximately $7,976,000 in 2023, and approximately $1,642,000 represents origination fees on such loans, compared to approximately $1,820,000 in 2023. The loans are principally secured by collateral consisting of real estate and accompanied by personal guarantees from the principals of the borrowers. Total operating costs and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024 were approximately $4,115,000, compared to approximately $4,353,000 for the year ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of $238,000, or 5.5%. The decrease in operating costs and expenses was primarily attributable to a decrease in interest expense due to a reduction in amounts borrowed relating to the use of the Company’s credit line, and a reduction in the special bonus to its officers. As of December 31, 2024, total shareholders' equity was approximately $43,265,000, compared to approximately $42,933,000 as of December 31, 2023. Assaf Ran, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, stated, “2024 was a risky and ultra challenging year for real estate lenders. The lingering high-interest rate environment weighs down on real estate investors' (our borrowers’) liquidity and profitability. Furthermore, the difference in interest rates between hard money lenders and conventional banks is not always significant enough to make refinancing a viable exit strategy for our loans.” “During 2024, our underwriting and operational policies were tested like never before ­ and we passed. I hope for continuous passing and a smooth 2025,” added Mr. Ran. About Manhattan Bridge Capital, Inc. Manhattan Bridge Capital, Inc. offers short-term secured, non–banking loans (sometimes referred to as ‘‘hard money’’ loans) to real estate investors to fund their acquisition, renovation, rehabilitation or improvement of properties located in the New York metropolitan area, including New Jersey and Connecticut, and in Florida. We operate the website: https://www.manhattanbridgecapital.com.    * At December 31, 2024 and 2023, cash and restricted cash included $23,750 and $1,587,773, respectively, of restricted cash.",https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/03/12/3041245/8691/en/Manhattan-Bridge-Capital-Inc-Reports-Results-for-2024.html

KraneShares Launches Single-Stock Levered ETF Suite With 2X Investment Exposure to Temu Parent PDD Holdings (KPDD) and Alibaba (KBAB),"March 12, 2025 08:30 ET","NEW YORK, March  12, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Krane Funds Advisors (“KraneShares”), an asset management firm known for its global exchange-traded funds (ETFs), today announced the launch of its Single-Stock Levered ETF Suite. The first ETFs in the Suite are the KraneShares 2X Long PDD Daily ETF (Ticker: KPDD) and the KraneShares 2X Long BABA Daily ETF (Ticker: KBAB), which both listed today. KPDD and KBAB seek daily investment results, before expenses and fees, of 2 times (200%) the daily percentage change of the US listings or American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) of Temu parent company PDD Holdings and Alibaba, respectively. PDD Holdings is the world’s fourth-largest E-Commerce retailer, operating in over 19 countries. PDD pioneered the rise of social-driven E-Commerce and has reshaped global retail through its international platform Temu, which surpassed Amazon in monthly active users and achieved $50 billion in annual gross merchandise value in 2024.1 Alibaba is the world’s third-largest E-Commerce retailer with a diversified business that spans E-Commerce, artificial intelligence (AI) & cloud computing services, logistics, payments & financial technology, media, and local services. Alibaba’s stock has seen recent positive momentum thanks to the launch of its industry-leading Qwen2.5 series large language model (LLM) and a new strategic partnership with Apple to integrate AI features in new iPhones sold in China. Both companies were founded amid the boom in China’s consumer economy and boast higher average historical annual revenue growth rates than many US-based counterparts, including Amazon.2 Both companies are also long-time top holdings in the KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF (Ticker: KWEB): PDD has a current weight of 6.51% and Alibaba has a current weight of 12.45%, as of March 11, 2025; holdings are subject to change. “China Internet continues to be an important global growth theme,” said James Maund, KraneShares Head of Capital Markets. “Our Single-Stock Levered ETF Suite provides a convenient way for bullish investors to gain levered exposure to top companies, including the largest China internet stocks.” For more information on the KraneShares Single Stock Levered ETFs, please visit https://kraneshares.com/kpdd or https://kraneshares.com/kbab/ or consult your financial advisor. Investors should be aware that they can lose their entire investment. Single-stock ETFs, unlike traditional ETFs that diversify across a range of stocks, focus solely on the performance of a single stock, significantly increasing investment risk. KraneShares ETFs aim for daily investment results that match 2x the daily performance of the underlying stock. Investors should be aware that returns may diverge from the stock's actual performance if held for more than a day. Due to their leveraged nature, these funds require close monitoring, as they can magnify both potential gains and losses. A flat performance of the underlying stock may lead to a loss, and in certain scenarios, these funds can incur losses even when the stock price fluctuates positively or negatively over several days. Therefore, they are not suitable for every investor and are specifically intended for knowledgeable individuals who grasp the mechanics of leveraged investing and are willing to actively manage risks. Understanding volatility is essential, as minor stock movements and increased volatility can result in returns that significantly deviate from the expected target. About KraneShares KraneShares is a specialist investment manager focused on China, Climate, and Alternatives. KraneShares seeks to provide innovative, high-conviction, and first-to-market strategies based on the firm and its partners' deep investing knowledge. KraneShares identifies and delivers groundbreaking capital market opportunities and believes investors should have cost-effective and transparent tools for attaining exposure to various asset classes. The firm was founded in 2013 and serves institutions and financial professionals globally. The firm is a signatory of the United Nations-supported Principles for Responsible Investment (UN PRI). Citation: Important Notes: Carefully consider the Funds’ investment objectives, risk factors, charges and expenses before investing. This and additional information can be found in the Funds’ full and summary prospectus, which may be obtained by visiting: www.kraneshares.com/kpdd or www.kraneshares.com/kbab. Read the prospectus carefully before investing. Risk Disclosures: Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal. There can be no assurance that a Fund will achieve its stated objectives. Indices are unmanaged and do not include the effect of fees. One cannot invest directly in an index. This information should not be relied upon as research, investment advice, or a recommendation regarding any products, strategies, or any security in particular. This material is strictly for illustrative, educational, or informational purposes and is subject to change. Certain content represents an assessment of the market environment at a specific time and is not intended to be a forecast of future events or a guarantee of future results; material is as of the dates noted and is subject to change without notice. The Funds may invest in derivatives, which are often more volatile than other investments and may magnify Funds' gains or losses. Derivatives (i.e., futures/forward contracts, swaps, and options) are contracts that derive their value from the performance of underlying assets. The primary risk of derivatives is that changes in the assets’ market values and the derivatives may not be proportionate, and some derivatives can have the potential for unlimited losses. Derivatives are also subject to liquidity and counterparty risks. The Funds are subject to liquidity risks, meaning that certain investments may become difficult to purchase or sell at a reasonable time and price. If transactions for these securities are large, it may not be possible to initiate them, which may cause the Funds to suffer losses. Counterparty risks are the risks of loss in the event that the counterparties to an agreement fail to make required payments or otherwise comply with the terms of the derivatives. The Underlying Stocks are exposed to numerous risks that can impact their revenues and viability, such as price volatility, management, inflation, global economic conditions, and natural disasters. Their performances may be influenced by trends in commerce, cloud computing, international trade policies, and regulatory changes. The Fund’s daily returns rely on the Underlying Stocks' performances and volatility. Issuer-specific factors may increase Fund investment volatility compared to the overall market. BABA faces risks from competition in e-commerce, economic uncertainties, demand declines, revenue concentration, geopolitical events, intellectual property issues, exchange rates, reliance on third-party manufacturing, shortages, cybersecurity threats, system failures, rising costs, government regulations, compliance expenses, litigation, taxes, debt, and talent retention. The Funds aim for daily investment results of 200% of the daily percentage changes of the Underlying Stocks. Their performances over longer periods will likely differ from the Underlying Stocks due to compounded returns, which significantly affect leveraged funds. If the Underlying Stocks perform poorly, the dollar losses for shareholders will be smaller if their investments have already decreased. Conversely, if the stocks perform well, future losses will be larger as the investment values have increased. Compounding effects become more pronounced with higher volatility and longer holding periods, impacting shareholders differently based on their investment durations and the stocks' volatility. Various factors can impact the Funds' correlations with Underlying Stocks, and achieving high correlations is not guaranteed. If the Funds fail to achieve correlation, they may not meet their investment objectives, with NAV changes varying significantly from 200% of the Underlying Stocks' changes. To maintain correlations, the Funds attempt daily rebalancing for consistent exposures. Major deviations can increase leverage risks. Market disruptions and volatility can hinder the Funds' ability to adjust. Target exposures fluctuate, making perfect 200% exposures unlikely, especially on volatile days. Other elements, like fees and market conditions, can also affect correlations. The Funds may change positions for tax efficiency, which could harm correlations. Large asset movements or trading discrepancies may lead to under- or overexposures, reducing the Funds' ability to meet their daily objectives. The Funds use leverage to gain investment exposure beyond their net assets, leading to potential greater losses in adverse conditions than non-leveraged funds. A decline in the Underlying Stocks' daily performance can magnify losses, decreasing the Funds' values by 2% for each 1% drop, excluding costs. Losses could exceed net assets if the Underlying Stocks fall over 50%. Due to limited investments, the Funds may need to limit or suspend the creation or redemption of Creation Units. During these times, shares might trade at significant premiums or discounts to their net asset values. If creations are halted, large redemptions could force the Funds to sell securities at unfavorable prices, increasing costs and taxable distributions to shareholders. The Underlying Stock is listed on an exchange, but an active trading market isn't guaranteed, and trading can be halted. A halt in the Underlying Stock usually leads to a halt in the Fund's shares. Trading may stop due to market conditions or exchange decisions, and halts can occur from extraordinary volatility under circuit breaker rules. Extended trading halts may hinder the Fund's ability to arrange necessary swaps for its investment strategy. Narrowly focused investments typically exhibit higher volatility. The Funds' assets are expected to be concentrated in a single stock. The securities or futures in that concentration could react similarly to market developments. Thus, the Funds are subject to loss due to adverse occurrences that affect that concentration. In addition to the normal risks associated with investing, investments in smaller companies typically exhibit higher volatility. KPPD and KBAB are non-diversified. The Chinese economy is an emerging market, vulnerable to domestic and regional economic and political changes, often showing more volatility than developed markets. Companies face risks from potential government interventions, and the export-driven economy is sensitive to downturns in key trading partners, impacting the Fund. U.S.-China tensions raise concerns over tariffs and trade restrictions, which could harm China’s exports and the Fund. China’s regulatory standards are less stringent than in the U.S., resulting in limited information about issuers. Tax laws are unclear and subject to change, potentially impacting the Fund and leading to unexpected liabilities for foreign investors. Fluctuations in currency of foreign countries may have an adverse effect to domestic currency values. The Fund is new and does not yet have a significant number of shares outstanding. If the Fund does not grow in size, it will be at greater risk than larger funds of wider bid-ask spreads for its shares, trading at a greater premium or discount to NAV, liquidation and/or a trading halt. ETF shares are bought and sold on an exchange at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. However, shares may be redeemed at NAV directly by certain authorized broker-dealers (Authorized Participants) in very large creation/redemption units. The returns shown do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Shares may trade at a premium or discount to their NAV in the secondary market. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Beginning 12/23/2020, market price returns are based on the official closing price of an ETF share or, if the official closing price isn't available, the midpoint between the national best bid and national best offer (""NBBO"") as of the time the ETF calculates the current NAV per share. Prior to that date, market price returns were based on the midpoint between the Bid and Ask price. NAVs are calculated using prices as of 4:00 PM Eastern Time. The KraneShares ETFs and KFA Funds ETFs are distributed by SEI Investments Distribution Company (SIDCO), 1 Freedom Valley Drive, Oaks, PA 19456, which is not affiliated with Krane Funds Advisors, LLC, the Investment Adviser for the Funds, or any sub-advisers for the Funds.

New Report Shows Indigenous Entrepreneurs Are Key to Canada’s Economic Resilience – But the Digital Divide is Holding Them Back,"March 12, 2025 07:00 ET","OTTAWA, Ontario, March  12, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As Canada navigates economic uncertainty and rising trade tensions with the U.S., a groundbreaking new report from the Indigenous Prosperity Foundation (IPF) reveals an overlooked opportunity to strengthen Canada’s economy from within. The report, Bridging the Digital Divide: Enhancing Access for Indigenous Entrepreneurs in Canada, shows that Indigenous businesses are primed for growth, yet digital barriers—high costs, unreliable broadband, and limited access to training—are holding them back from contributing fully to the national economy. “Indigenous entrepreneurs are not just an untapped economic force—we are an essential part of Canada’s future prosperity,” said Michelle Okere, Executive Director of IPF. “In a time of global economic uncertainty, investing in Indigenous businesses is not charity—it is smart economic policy. When we create pathways for Indigenous-led innovation, digital transformation, and market expansion, we strengthen Canada’s competitiveness, resilience, and productivity.” The report—now available for download at indigenousfoundation.ca/digital—finds that Indigenous-owned businesses contribute over $30 billion annually to Canada’s economy yet remain disproportionately excluded from the digital economy, limiting their ability to scale, export, and compete globally. The research identifies key obstacles, including: Unlocking Indigenous Business Growth = A Stronger Canada The report outlines a clear roadmap for unleashing Indigenous business potential and positioning Canada as a leader in inclusive economic growth. Priority actions include: “We know that businesses that invest in digital transformation grow faster, hire more people, and generate higher revenues. Indigenous entrepreneurs are ready to seize these opportunities—if the right conditions are in place. By eliminating digital barriers, Canada can unlock billions in new economic activity, drive productivity, and create jobs across the country,” added Okere. A National Economic Priority As Canada navigates shifting trade policies, labour shortages, and productivity challenges, accelerating Indigenous business growth is a strategic advantage. Indigenous businesses are among the fastest-growing in the country. By enabling them to scale, integrate into supply chains, and access new markets, Canada can strengthen its economy, enhance domestic resilience, and drive long-term prosperity. “This is about economic self-determination and national resilience. Investing in Indigenous businesses is investing in Canada’s future,” said Okere. “We need all hands on deck—government, industry, and financial institutions—to support solutions that don’t just close the digital gap but drive long-term economic success for all Canadians.” Media & Download Information The full report is available for download at indigenousfoundation.ca/digital.

Established by the National Aboriginal Capital Corporations Association (NACCA), IPF fosters long-term, sustainable Indigenous business growth by providing access to digital tools, training, mentorship, and capital.

Wendel announces the successful placement of Bureau Veritas shares as part of a prepaid 3-year forward sale representing approximately 6.7% of Bureau Veritas share capital,"March 12, 2025 03:00 ET","NOT FOR RELEASE, PUBLICATION OR DISTRIBUTION, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, IN OR INTO THE UNITED STATES, AUSTRALIA, JAPAN OR ANY OTHER JURISDICTION IN WHICH SUCH DISTRIBUTION WOULD BE PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW Wendel announces the successful placement of Bureau Veritas shares as part of a prepaid 3-year forward sale representing approximately 6.7% of Bureau Veritas share capital and increases its financial flexibility by reducing the pro forma1 loan-to-value ratio to approximately 17% Wendel today announces the successful placement of 30,357,140 shares of Bureau Veritas (representing approximately 6.7% of Bureau Veritas’ share capital2) at a price of €27.25 per share (the “Offering Price”). As indicated in the press release published yesterday, Wendel entered into a prepaid 3-year forward sale agreement with BNP Paribas (the “Forward Bank”) over 30,357,140 shares of Bureau Veritas (the “Forward Sale Transaction”). Simultaneously with the Forward Sale Transaction, Wendel entered into a call spread transaction to benefit from up to c.15% of the stock price appreciation over the next three years on the equivalent number of shares underlying the Forward Sale Transaction, with BNP Paribas and Morgan Stanley Europe SE (the “Call Spread Banks”) (the “Call Spread Transaction”, and together with the Forward Sale Transaction, the “Transactions”), highlighting Wendel’s strong belief in Bureau Veritas’ value creation potential. The Offering Price will be used as a reference price for the Transactions. The Transactions will immediately generate net cash proceeds of approximately €750 million to Wendel, which will further support the acceleration of its transition towards a dual model based on Principal Investments and Asset Management to drive higher performance and enhanced shareholder returns, while continuing to benefit from the prospects of Bureau Veritas. Pro forma of the proceeds generated by the announced Transactions and taking into account the upcoming closing of the acquisition of Monroe Capital, Wendel’s loan-to-value (LTV) ratio is expected to come down to approximately 17%. As part of the Transactions, BNP Paribas and Morgan Stanley (the “Joint Global Coordinators” and together with the Forward Bank and the Call Spread Banks, the “Banks”) conducted a private placement of 30,357,140 shares corresponding to the number of shares underlying the Forward Sale Transaction through an accelerated bookbuild offering (the “Offering”). The Bureau Veritas shares sold through the Offering were borrowed by the Forward Bank in the market. As part of the Call Spread Transaction, the Call Spread Banks bought 5.4 million shares in the Offering to hedge their positions. Settlement and delivery of the Offering will take place on March 14, 2025. As per the terms of the Transactions, the shares underlying the Forward Sale Transaction that are owned by Wendel have been pledged in favour of BNP Paribas. Wendel will, subject to the share pledge, retain the full ownership of the 30,357,140 shares and associated double voting rights until the physical settlement of the Forward Sale Transaction (i.e., until March 17, 2028). Wendel reiterates its support to Bureau Veritas’ management and its Leap|28 strategic plan. As part of the Transactions, Wendel agreed to enter into a lockup undertaking of 180 days from the date of the settlement of the Offering, subject to customary exemptions3. Wendel is advised by Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP and d’Angelin & Co. The Banks are advised by Clifford Chance LLP. Laurent Mignon, Wendel Group CEO said: ""Wendel immediately increases its financial flexibility and pursues its diversification strategy, thanks to a transaction enabling it to sell forward around a quarter of its Bureau Veritas shares with a term of three years. This forward sale also allows us to maintain a significant exposure to the growth of the Bureau Veritas share price, as well as 26.5% of the capital and 41.2% of the voting rights. Very confident in the outlook for Bureau Veritas, which Wendel has supported since 1995, we will continue to support it in its value creation strategy as described in its LEAP|28 plan. "" This press release is for information purposes only and does not, and shall not, constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy or subscribe any securities nor a solicitation to offer to purchase or to subscribe securities in any jurisdiction and does not constitute a public offer in any jurisdiction, including in France.

Recent Company Highlights About AldoxorubicinAldoxorubicin is a rationally engineered cytotoxic which combines doxorubicin, a widely used chemotherapeutic agent, with a novel linker molecule that binds in inactive form to circulating albumin, the most abundant protein in the bloodstream. Protein-hungry tumors concentrate albumin, which facilitates the delivery of the chemotoxin to tumor sites. In the acidic environment of the tumor, but not the neutral environment of healthy tissues, doxorubicin is released in active form. Typically, doxorubicin is delivered systemically and is highly toxic, which limits its dose to a level below its maximum therapeutic benefit. Doxorubicin also is associated with many side effects, especially the potential for damage to heart muscle at cumulative doses greater than 450 mg/m2. Using this acid-sensitive linker technology, aldoxorubicin delivers greater doses of doxorubicin (3 ½ to 4 times). To date, there has been no evidence of clinically significant effects of aldoxorubicin on heart muscle, even at cumulative doses of the drug well in excess of 5,000 mg/m2. Aldoxorubicin is the first-ever single agent to show superiority over doxorubicin in a randomized clinical trial in first-line soft tissue sarcoma. Forward-Looking Statements This press release may contain certain statements relating to future results which are forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, whether the company will be able to secure new financing to fund its operations and clinical programs, or receive clearance from the FDA of its 505(b)(2) application for Aldoxorubicin. These statements are not historical facts, but instead represent only LadRx’s belief regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of LadRx’s control. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from the events or results described in the forward-looking statements; and other risks and uncertainties described in the most recent annual and quarterly reports filed by LadRx with the SEC, including disclosures under the heading “Risk Factors,” and current reports filed since the date of the LadRx’s most recent annual report.

Against the backdrop of increased fossil fuel investment in the short and medium term, natural resources businesses have ambitious long-term investment plans in clean energy technology. The risk outlook is more complex and interconnected than ever before as companies balance conflicting priorities.

The net asset value of EfTEN Real Estate Fund AS shares as of 28.02.2025,"March 12, 2025 02:30 ET","EfTEN Real Estate Fund AS earned consolidated rental income of EUR 2,566 thousand in February, which is EUR 9 thousand more than in January. The rental income increased mainly due to the quarterly increase in rental income in Ermi care home, which will start generating full rental income from August this year. The ICONFIT production and warehouse, which the fund acquired last autumn, will be completed in April 2025, after which the fund’s monthly rental income will increase by nearly EUR 40 thousand. The fund’s vacancy rate remained at 3.9% in February, with the office space vacancy rate also staying unchanged at 14%. In the office buildings located at Menulio 11 in Vilnius and Pärnu mnt 102 in Tallinn, vacant rental spaces are being redesigned and constructed into smaller units in line with market expectations, and some new spaces already have prospective tenants. The fund’s consolidated EBITDA was EUR 2,149 thousand in February, which is EUR 106 thousand more than in January. The growth in EBITDA was mainly driven by lower property maintenance costs for investment properties. The weighted average interest rate of the fund's subsidiaries’ loans decreased to 4.58% by the end of February, which is 0.2 percentage points lower than at the end of January. Since the peak of interest rates in December 2023, the weighted average interest rate on bank loans has decreased by a total of 1.33 percentage points. While the fund’s loan obligations have increased by 0.8% due to the addition of new projects, its consolidated interest expenses have decreased by 16% compared to a year ago. The fund has generated adjusted cash flow (EBITDA minus loan and interest payments) of EUR 1,829 thousand in the first two months of this year, which is EUR 147 thousand (8.8%) more than in the same period last year. The fund’s consolidated cash balance grew by EUR 762 thousand in January, reaching EUR 22,388 thousand (including short-term deposits) as of 28.02.2025. As of 28.02.2025, the fund’s net asset value (NAV) per share was EUR 20.6189, and the EPRA NRV was EUR 21.476. The NAV per share increased by 0.6% in February, in line with the usual trend.

Sampo to launch a long-term incentive scheme for 2025–2027,"March 12, 2025 10:45 ET","Sampo plc, stock exchange release, 12 March 2025 at 4:45 pm EET Sampo to launch a long-term incentive scheme for 2025–2027 The Board of Directors of Sampo plc has today decided to adopt a performance based long-term incentive scheme for the Group Executive Committee (including the Group CEO) and other senior leaders and key employees of Sampo Group. The scheme is based on the same structure as the previous long-term incentive scheme launched by Sampo in 2024. Sampo aims to ensure that management incentives are aligned with the shareholders’ interests and Group strategy. The long-term incentive scheme 2025 (LTI 2025) covers the members of the Group Executive Committee (including the Group CEO) and approximately ninety-three (93) senior leaders and key employees whose efforts and abilities have a direct impact on Sampo Group’s operational performance and strategy execution. Sampo’s Board of Directors is not included in the scheme. The incentive scheme participants will be granted performance incentive units in 2025, the maximum number of performance incentive units will be no more than 2,250,000 in total. The performance incentive units have a three-year performance period covering financial years 2025–2027, with subsequent deferral periods according to the rules and regulations applicable to Sampo Group. To achieve a maximum reward from the LTI 2025, excellent financial and operational performance is required. The performance assessment will be based on the following performance criteria: • Relative total shareholder return • Adjusted absolute total shareholder return • Underwriting profit growth • Sustainability charter: Group and subsidiary balanced scorecards relating to development, implementation and execution on Science Based Targets. In addition, the performance incentive units are subject to Sampo A share price movements over the performance period. The reward will be settled as a cash compensation. Participants subject to the deferral rule according to the remuneration policies in force in the relevant Sampo Group companies at the launch of LTI 2025 are mandated to purchase Sampo A shares net after tax with 50 per cent of the reward. The deferral period is three years, and the Board of Directors will perform a risk and compliance assessment before any shares are released to participants. The total maximum number of performance incentive units that can vest to participants under the LTI 2025 is 688,209 for the Group CEO and other members of the Group Executive Committee, and a maximum of 1,561,791 for senior leaders and key employees. The estimated cost of the LTI 2025 is approximately EUR 35 million. The estimation is based on a maximum vesting of incentive units and a 50 per cent increase of the Sampo A share price compared to 1 January 2025. A summary of the LTI 2025 is available at www.sampo.com/incentiveterms. Long-term incentive schemes in Sampo plc are designed to attract and retain highly competent, high-performing people that have the ability, experience, and skills to deliver on Sampo’s long-term strategy and creating shareholder value, but at the same time safeguard sustainable business practices and the long-term financial stability of the Group.

Defiance Launches IONX: 2X Leveraged ETF for IonQ,"March 12, 2025 06:30 ET","MIAMI, March  12, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Defiance ETFs introduces IONX, the Defiance Daily Target 2X Long IONQ ETF, a 2X leveraged single-stock ETF designed to provide amplified exposure to IonQ, Inc. (NYSE: IONQ). This ETF offers traders a way to seek enhanced returns on IonQ without requiring a margin account. IONX seeks daily investment results that correspond to twice (200%) the daily percentage change of IonQ, a leader in quantum computing, advancing the industry with cutting-edge innovations and strategic partnerships. “IONX offers a compelling opportunity for investors seeking amplified exposure to IONQ, a leader in quantum computing,” said Sylvia Jablonski, CEO of Defiance ETFs. “With ongoing technological developments, strategic industry partnerships, and a growing presence in the sector, IONQ continues to play a key role in the evolution of quantum innovation.” For more information, visit DefianceETFs.com. The Fund is not intended to be used by, and is not appropriate for, investors who do not intend to actively monitor and manage their portfolios. The Fund pursues a daily leveraged investment objective, which means that the Fund is riskier than alternatives that do not use leverage because the Fund magnifies the performance of the Underlying Security. The Fund is not suitable for all investors. The Fund is designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged (2X) investment results, understand the risks associated with the use of leverage, and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently. For periods longer than a single day, the Fund will lose money if the Underlying Security’s performance is flat, and it is possible that the Fund will lose money even if the Underlying Security’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. An investor could lose the full principal value of his/her investment within a single day. An investment in IONX is not an investment in IonQ, Inc. About Defiance ETFs Founded in 2018, Defiance is at the forefront of ETF innovation. Defiance is a leading ETF issuer specializing in thematic, income, and leveraged ETFs. Our first-mover leveraged single-stock ETFs empower investors to take amplified positions in high-growth companies, providing precise leverage exposure without the need to open a margin account. IMPORTANT DISCLOSURES Defiance ETFs LLC is the ETF sponsor. The Fund’s investment adviser is Tidal Investments, LLC (“Tidal” or the “Adviser”). The Funds’ investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses must be considered carefully before investing. The prospectus and summary prospectus contain this and other important information about the investment company. Please read carefully before investing. A hard copy of the prospectuses can be requested by calling 833.333.9383. Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. As an ETF, the funds’ may trade at a premium or discount to NAV. Shares of any ETF are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. A portfolio concentrated in a single industry or country, may be subject to a higher degree of risk. IONQ Risks: The Fund invests in swap contracts and options that are based on the share price of IONQ. This subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it owned shares of IONQ even though it does not. Indirect Investment Risk. IONQ is not affiliated with the Trust, the Fund, or the Adviser, or their respective affiliates and is not involved with this offering in any way and has no obligation to consider your Shares in taking any corporate actions that might affect the value of Shares. Trading Risk. The trading price of the fund may be subject to volatility and could experience wide fluctuations due to various factors. Short sellers may also play a significant role in trading IONQ potentially affecting the supply and demand dynamics and contributing to market price volatility. Public perception and external factors beyond the company’s control may influence IONQ’s stock price disproportionately. Performance Risk. IONQ may fail to meet publicly announced guidelines or other expectations about its business, which could cause the price of IONQ to decline. IONQ Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals Risks. Companies in the technology hardware, storage, and peripherals industry may face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, which can pressure profit margins and market share. These companies often rely on complex supply chains and third-party providers for components, manufacturing, and services. Additionally, operations may be impacted by resource constraints, including shortages of electricity, rare earth elements, or other essential materials. Companies in this industry are also exposed to cybersecurity threats, intellectual property risks, and evolving technological standards, which may increase operational costs and hinder competitiveness. IONQ Business Risks: Dependence on proprietary ion trap technology and specific isotopic materials introduces supply chain risks, while compatibility with industry-standard software and hardware remains a concern. IONQ is also exposed to risks related to international expansion, government contracts, and regulatory changes, including tariffs and trade restrictions. IONX Fund Risks Leverage Risk. The Fund obtains investment exposure in excess of its net assets by utilizing leverage and may lose more money in market conditions that are adverse to its investment objective than a fund that does not utilize leverage. An investment in the Fund is exposed to the risk that a decline in the daily performance of the Underlying Security will be magnified. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. Daily rebalancing of the Fund’s holdings pursuant to its daily investment objective causes a much greater number of portfolio transactions when compared to most ETFs. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Markets for securities or financial instruments could be disrupted by a number of events, including, but not limited to, an economic crisis, natural disasters, epidemics/pandemics, new legislation or regulatory changes inside or outside the United States. Derivatives Risk. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, leverage, imperfect daily correlations with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Compounding and Market Volatility Risk. The Fund has a daily leveraged investment objective and the Fund’s performance for periods greater than a trading day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which is very likely to differ from two times (200%) the Underlying Security’s performance, before the Fund’s management fee and other expenses. Fixed Income Securities Risk. When the Fund invests in fixed income securities, the value of your investment in the Fund will fluctuate with changes in interest rates. Typically, a rise in interest rates causes a decline in the value of fixed income securities owned by the Fund. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk of the market generally. The value of the Fund, which focuses on an individual security, may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Diversification does not ensure a profit nor protect against loss in a declining market. Brokerage Commissions may be charged on trades.
