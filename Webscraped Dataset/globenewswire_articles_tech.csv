Shutter Network Launches Shutter API: Decentralized Threshold Encryption That Paves the Way for Trustless Web3,"March 12, 2025 07:00 ET","Mainz, Germany, March  12, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --  Shutter Network, a leading innovator in decentralized privacy solutions, today announces the launch of Shutter API, a new tool that makes powerful encryption technology simple and accessible for Web2 and Web3 projects alike. Available for immediate integration, this new toolset provides developers with an easy and flexible method to encrypt critical on-chain or off-chain data, facilitating new dApp possibilities ranging from sealed-bid auctions and fair on-chain gaming to sealed RFPs in corporate procurement and parimutuel betting, all without relying on Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) or centralized custodians. “If information is money, then encryption is incredibly powerful because it safeguards that information,” stated Heiko Franßen, CEO of brainbot GmbH, a core contributor to Shutter Network. “With Shutter API, founders and developers can offer new features that weren’t practical before like sealed-bid auctions or fully private multiplayer games, while giving users the confidence that their data is protected at every step and remaining truly decentralized.” Despite blockchain’s promise of transparency, many dApps could benefit from programmable privacy to stay provably fair and support more diverse features. Fairness means all participants have the same information at the same time - no one, including a centralized controlling entity can see inside the data envelope ahead of others. This decentralized approach provides stronger protection against potential corruption or manipulation. As a result, Shutter API enables a wide range of exciting use cases for Web3 that were previously impractical or impossible, including: A Simple ‘Sealed Envelope’ for Web3 Shutter API uses an intuitive three-step process that both developers and users alike can easily understand: For users, this creates an experience where their actions (bids, votes, moves, or predictions) remain sealed in an envelope until the designated time. For example, in an NFT auction, bidders can be confident that their bids remain completely private until the auction closes, preventing auction operators or other bidders from gaining unfair advantages. ""The potential for Shutter API extends far beyond what we've already seen in production,"" noted Franßen. ""As we move toward an era where information asymmetry threatens both user experience and blockchain's core values, this technology is a necessity for maintaining the promise of a truly fair and decentralized Web3 ecosystem.” How Shutter API Works Unlike TEE-based systems that depend on specialized hardware and introduce a single point of failure, Shutter API provides access to a distributed threshold encryption service powered by Keypers, a network of node operators that collaboratively generate encryption keys and securely release them according to predefined rules. For developers, integration is straightforward: encrypt moves, bids, or transaction data with just a few lines of code. The API requires familiarity with only four simple calls, and the complementary Shutter SDK, a TypeScript library, makes local encryption/decryption even easier. The API's flexible design allows for customization based on specific application needs, with automated decryption triggers that can be set for specific times or triggered by predefined events. The Keyper network's distributed architecture eliminates single points of failure while maintaining high availability. Each Keyper holds only a fragment of the decryption capability, meaning the network remains secure even if individual nodes are compromised. Built on Proven Technology Shutter's threshold encryption technology has already demonstrated its effectiveness in critical Web3 infrastructure. An encrypted mempool is available on the Gnosis Chain to protect against transaction manipulation, while Snapshot has implemented the technology for all DAOs on its platform, with over 600 currently using shielded voting, including major projects like Arbitrum and Bankless. Snapshot will also be converting its systems to use the new Shutter API. ""Today’s launch of Shutter API is a major step towards realizing our vision of a truly decentralized ecosystem,"" said Franßen. ""We are committed to empowering Web3 projects to craft applications that adhere to the highest standards of privacy and security, transforming the way that people interact with new technologies."" Industry Impact and Adoption In addition to enabling fresh use cases, Shutter API addresses a fundamental challenge in digital interactions known as the ‘Free Option Problem’, where one party can decide to back out or exploit extra knowledge if data reveals an advantage. This solution removes the need to trust centralized entities that promise fairness until the stakes become high enough to tempt them. By removing the need to trust any single centralized player, Shutter’s threshold encryption gives dApp providers a new way to guarantee fairness for their users without the need for extra effort or hardware. ""Shutter is a solution for the Free Option Problem, where one of the parties can decide to back down and not keep their commitment,"" explains Franßen. ""It removes the trust assumption to a centralized player that promises to be trustworthy. This changes the way app providers can guarantee their users a new level of protection without additional effort."" This capability has wide-ranging implications for various sectors in the Web3 ecosystem that currently suffer from information asymmetry problems: By providing developers with an easy and flexible method to integrate robust privacy measures, Shutter API helps make applications more trustworthy and fair for all participants. Shutter API is live now, giving developers immediate access to advanced encryption tools for enhancing or completely reimagining their dApps.

An explanation of these measures is included below under the heading “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” 2025 Financial Outlook Based on information available as of March 11, 2025, the Company is announcing full 2025 outlook items as follows: These statements are forward-looking and actual results may differ materially. Refer to the “Forward-Looking Statements” below for information on the factors that could cause Synchronoss' actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Upcoming Conference ParticipationThe Company today announced that members of the management team will participate in two upcoming investor conferences: A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results has been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release. An explanation of these measures is included below under the heading ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures."" With respect to forward-looking statements related to adjusted EBITDA, adjusted gross margin and free cash flow, the Company has relied upon the exception in item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K and has not provided a quantitative reconciliation of (i) forecasted adjusted EBITDA to forecasted GAAP net income (loss) attributable to Synchronoss or to forecasted GAAP income (loss) from operations, before taxes, (ii) adjusted gross margin to GAAP gross margin and (iii) free cash flow to income (loss) from operations within this earnings release because the Company is unable, without making unreasonable efforts, to calculate certain reconciling items relating to those financial measures with confidence. These items include, but are not limited to, other income, other expense, (provision) benefit for income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, gain (loss) on divestitures, net (loss) income attributable to redeemable non-controlling interests. Conference CallSynchronoss will hold a conference call today, March 11, 2025, at 4:30 p.m. Eastern time (1:30 p.m. Pacific time) to discuss these results. Synchronoss management will host the call, followed by a question-and-answer period. Dial-In Number: 877-451-6152 (domestic) or 201-389-0879 (international)Conference ID: 13751475 The conference call will be broadcast live and available for replay here and via the Investor Relations section of Synchronoss' website at www.synchronoss.com. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Synchronoss has provided in this release selected financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with GAAP although this non-GAAP financial information is derived from numbers that have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. This information includes adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to Synchronoss, diluted non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, free cash flow, adjusted free cash flow (which excludes cash payments and receipts related to non-core business activities) and recurring revenue. The Company believes that the exclusion of non-routine cash-settled expenses, such as litigation and remediation costs (net) and restructuring costs in the calculation of adjusted free cash flow which do not correlate to the operation of its business, provide for more useful period-to-period comparisons of the Company’s results. Synchronoss uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing its financial results and believes they are useful to investors, as a supplement to GAAP measures, in evaluating Synchronoss’ ongoing operational performance. Synchronoss believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends, and in comparing its financial results with other companies in Synchronoss’ industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. As noted, the non-GAAP financial results discussed above add back or deduct certain expenses. These expenses include but are not limited to the following: fair value of stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related costs, restructuring, transition and cease-use lease expense, litigation, remediation and refiling costs, depreciation and amortization, interest income, interest expense, net loss (income) from discontinued operations, loss (gain) on divestitures, other (income) expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, net loss (income) attributable to non-controlling interests and preferred dividends. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as detailed above. Investors are encouraged to also review the Balance Sheet, Statement of Operations, and Statement of Cash Flow. As previously mentioned, a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results has been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release.

"HR Leaders Face 'Year of Contention' Amidst Labor Tensions, Payscale's 2025 Compensation Best Practices Report Reveals","March 12, 2025 09:00 ET","SEATTLE, March  12, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Today, Payscale Inc., the leading provider of compensation data, software and services, released its flagship report, the 2025 Compensation Best Practices Report (CBPR). Payscale’s sixteenth comprehensive annual report reveals the latest workplace and compensation trends, analyzing data and insights from industry professionals and HR leaders amidst DEI backlash, labor tensions, and broadening pay transparency legislation. ""We’re anticipating a ‘Year of Contention,’ as 2025 could bring a clash between employers tightening budgets and employees advocating for fair pay and better working conditions,” said Payscale’s Chief People Officer, Lexi Clarke. “In this environment, listening to employees and leading with fairness isn’t just the right thing to do—it’s a competitive advantage. A cooling labor market, rising pay transparency and the potential for an economic rebound could reignite the battle for top talent. Companies that invest in compensation strategy and prioritize equitable practices will be best positioned to attract, retain, and empower their workforce."" Key takeaways from the 2025 CBPR include: Labor Tensions, Pay Increases and Remote Work: Employers are balancing cost controls with the demands of a competitive labor market where pay transparency and retention are key. DEI and Pay Equity: Despite backlash against DEI and recent executive orders creating uncertainty, employers who took Payscale’s survey in late 2024 overwhelmingly showed support for DEI initiatives, especially pay equity, which is essential to talent acquisition and retention. Pay Transparency: Pay transparency continues to advance at the state level and more employers are targeting increased transparency as more employees are asking about it. Compensation Preparedness, Technology and AI: Following mainstream adoption of AI, HR is actively interested in exploring how advances in technology can make compensation management more accurate and efficient. “Navigating the complexities of compensation management remains a top challenge for employers today, particularly as they strive to balance fair pay strategies with evolving employee expectations, economic uncertainty, and the rise of AI,"" said Ruth Thomas, pay equity strategist at Payscale. ""Despite waning support, DEI initiatives remain a competitive advantage—equity should be seen as synonymous with merit, not separate from it. While political pressures are making companies more cautious, maintaining pay equity is essential for attracting and retaining top talent. Our analysis highlights this, identifying pay equity analysis, increased pay transparency, and confidence in market pricing as the most critical compensation activities for 2025.” Payscale’s 2025 Compensation Best Practices Report analyzes survey data from 3,595 respondents gathered between November 2024 and December 2024. The report includes select cuts of the data across organization size, business performance, industry, and compensation maturity. The full report and its methodology can be accessed in its entirety at Payscale.com/research-and-insights/CBPR.

Scimplify bags $40M to transform specialty chemicals manufacturing amid global supply chain upheaval,"March 12, 2025 10:00 ET","Houston, March  12, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The global chemical supply chain is being rewritten. Fluctuating tariffs, trade wars, and growing geopolitical tensions are forcing critical industries to scramble for new manufacturing solutions. In specialty chemicals - the essential ingredients powering everything from pharmaceuticals to agriculture - this disruption is even more acute due to a fragmented and inflexible supply base. Today, Scimplify announces a $40 million Series B funding round to scale its revolutionary platform that's fundamentally transforming how specialty chemicals are developed, manufactured, and distributed worldwide. The $40m series B funding round was co-led by Accel and Bertelsmann India Investments with participation from UMI and existing investors including Omnivore and 3one4 Capital. This latest round brings Scimplify's total funding to $54 million, following $13.5 million raised across seed and Series A rounds. The investment will supercharge the company's already impressive international growth, with exports currently reaching 16 countries and plans to aggressively expand both geographically and into new industry segments.  Scimpify founders: (L to R) Salil Srivastava, Sachin Santhosh and Dheeraj Dhingra. Founded in mid-2023, the company’s co-founders include Salil Srivastava, Sachin Santhosh, and Dheeraj Dhingra. These veterans spent the previous decade bringing Indian factories to a global customer base, Scimplify brings specialty chemical manufacturing under one roof. Their breakthrough approach: a full-stack solution that combines in-house scientific expertise with a massive network of over 200 specialized manufacturing plants across low-cost regions. This creates a true 'plug and play' alternative to traditional manufacturing - customers simply bring their chemical needs, and Scimplify handles everything from R&D to specialized production, leveraging the perfect manufacturing partner for each specific chemistry without the capital investment or operational complexity of traditional approaches. ""Global supply chains are shifting like never before,"" says Sachin Santhosh, Co-Founder at Scimplify. ""For decades, specialty chemical manufacturers have invested millions in facilities that can only produce a handful of compounds, often running at partial capacity while lacking R&D capabilities. This creates a paradox: excess capacity alongside supply shortages. We've flipped this model, connecting our scientific teams with hundreds of manufacturing plants to create a responsive ecosystem that can adapt as market needs shift."" The timing for this couldn't be more critical. As countries move to secure their supply chains and reduce dependencies on single regions, the specialty chemicals sector faces a once-in-a-generation transformation. The impact of Scimplify’s approach is being felt immediately. US customers previously locked into Chinese supply chains for critical specialty chemicals are now accessing superior alternatives from India without the headaches of establishing ground teams or navigating complex onboarding processes. This allows them to accelerate innovation while building more resilient and cost-effective supply networks. Scimplify offers a full stack model to its customers where they can entrust end to end supply responsibilities for key products under one umbrella. The company now serves leading innovators and manufacturers across life sciences, crop sciences, and industrial chemicals in major markets including the US, Europe and Japan. What separates Scimplify from traditional manufacturers is its speed and flexibility. While competitors remain anchored to fixed assets and limited chemistries, Scimplify can rapidly pivot across different chemical processes and scale production based on real-time customer needs. Their R&D capabilities provide expertise typically inaccessible to individual manufacturers, allowing them to solve complex chemical challenges that others simply cannot address. ""Each specialty chemical requires significant scientific know-how and R&D investment,"" adds Sachin Santhosh. ""We've built a model that brings together the best scientific minds with hundreds of highly specialized manufacturing plants, creating a chemistry powerhouse that can tackle virtually any chemical challenge across critical industries."" Rachit Parekh, Principal at Accel said, “The global supply chain for specialty chemicals is at an inflection point. Traditional manufacturing supply chains, lack the flexibility required in todays geopolitical environment as well as the rapid changes in end customer requirements. Scimplify is building an R&D led global manufacturing network which allows for flexibility coupled with innovation. At Accel, we have had a long standing thesis that R&D led speciality chemical companies which take advantage of the deep pool of manufacturing capabiltiies in India and globally can create global giants. We have been following the Scimplify journey from day 0 and their execution has been impressive. We look forward to this partnership and working with the team over the next decade.” Rohit Sood, Partner at Bertelsmann India Investments added: “We are excited to significantly double down on our commitment to Scimplify, after our initial investment last year. Their execution on the ground has been among the best we’ve seen, driving not just impressive topline growth but also a rapid multi-country export scale-up and the establishment of a cutting-edge R&D facility in Hyderabad. Scimplify is uniquely positioned to harness India’s strengths in specialty chemicals and capitalize on the evolving dynamics of global procurement in this sector.” Looking ahead, Scimplify plans to aggressively expand its international footprint while continually adding new industry segments through enhanced R&D capabilities. The company is positioning itself at the center of a fundamental shift in global chemical manufacturing, building the infrastructure for a more resilient, innovative, and responsive industry.

BCH miners use AI cloud mining to quickly become a new source of income for Dogecoin enthusiasts,"March 11, 2025 18:00 ET","Newport, UK, March  11, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cryptocurrency mining has always been an easy way to earn passive income, but let’s face it — it’s become expensive, competitive, and a huge hassle for most people. Gone are the days of setting up a couple of GPUs in your basement and raking in the cash. Today, large mining farms dominate, driving up costs and making it out of reach for the average person. But here’s the good news: Dogecoin cloud mining is changing the game, and it could completely outperform traditional mining this year.  Dogecoin has come a long way from being a pop culture phenomenon to becoming one of the most active cryptocurrencies. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a limited supply and a mining difficulty that increases over time, Dogecoin uses an inflationary model. This means that miners will always receive rewards, making it a more sustainable option for long-term profitability. Additionally, Dogecoin is merged-mined with Litecoin, meaning miners can receive rewards from both networks without having to put in any extra effort. This alone makes it a more attractive option than Bitcoin for many miners. But the real game changer is cloud mining . Traditional mining has become too expensive and resource-intensive , and AI-driven cloud mining is a more accessible and profitable way for digital assets to be acquired in the future. That’s where cloud mining comes in. It allows anyone to mine without having to deal with hardware, electricity costs, or complicated setups. Instead, you rent mining power from a remote data center, which does all the heavy lifting for you. Start DOGE cloud mining with BCH miner BCH Miner is the leading cloud mining platform in the field. It provides free cloud mining services and can earn you up to $ 68,750 per day . Unlike most platforms, BCH Miner uses AI-driven mining strategies to optimize efficiency and maximize returns. This means that even if you know nothing about mining, you can still profit from it. The best part? You don’t need to spend thousands of dollars on hardware or worry about maintenance. You just sign up, choose a mining plan, and start earning passive income right away. Signing up for BCH Miner is very simple. The registration process is simple, and new users receive a $10 bonus to start mining immediately. After signing up, you only need to choose a plan, without having to wait for complex configuration or technical support. Here are the different contract plans that BCHMiner offers to users: Basic contract:Investment amount: $100,maturity payoff:$100 + $8 Basic contract:Investment amount: $600,Expiration income:$600+$46 Basic contract:Investment amount: $1,200,Expiration proceeds: $1,200+ $201 Senior contract:Investment amount: $15,000,maturity income: $15,000 + $13,080 Super Contract:Investment Amount: $100,000,Expiration Return: $100,000 + $77,400 For more contract details, please visit the official website: https://www.btxminer.com/xml/index.html#/ You can deposit using a variety of cryptocurrencies, including BTC, ETH, USDT (TRC20 and ERC20), LTC, USDC, BCH, DOGE, XRP, SOL, so users around the world can easily participate. You can even track your earnings in real-time through their dashboard, so you can see exactly how much money you’re making at any given time. When you need to withdraw your profits, BCH Miner makes it quick and easy, processing withdrawals in just a few minutes. Another reason why cloud mining is a good option is that it is energy-efficient. Traditional mining equipment consumes a staggering amount of electricity, is expensive to run, and is harmful to the environment. BCH miners use renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power. This reduces operating costs and enables long-term sustainable mining. While Bitcoin miners are dealing with rising electricity costs, cloud miners are making steady profits without the environmental burden. Security is a big concern in the cryptocurrency space, and BCH Miner takes it very seriously. The platform uses top-level security measures, including McAfee and Cloudflare security measures, to ensure your funds are safe. 90% of assets are stored offline in cold wallets, so hackers can't get to them. Unlike other platforms that leave you vulnerable to cyberattacks, BCH Miner lets you sit back and relax while you earn money. Another benefit of using BCH Miner is the referral program. In addition to your mining profits, you can earn up to $20,000 per month simply by inviting friends to join the platform. It's a way to earn more passive income without investing more money. Whether you're actively mining or just referring others, there are many ways to make money with BCH Miner. Conclusion Therefore, Dogecoin mining is a potentially profitable activity for both beginners and experienced miners. Consider your resources and goals, choose the appropriate mining method, and exercise caution when choosing a platform. With the right approach, Dogecoin can become not only a hobby, but also a source of income!

OptimizeRx Reports Strong Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Financial Results,"March 12, 2025 07:30 ET","WALTHAM, Mass., March  12, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- OptimizeRx Corp. (the “Company”) (Nasdaq: OPRX), a leading provider of healthcare technology solutions helping life sciences companies reach and engage healthcare professionals (HCPs) and patients, today announced results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2024. Stephen L. Silvestro, OptimizeRx CEO commented, ""I’m incredibly proud of our strong fourth quarter and full year 2024 results and the momentum that we've achieved since we reported third quarter results last November, including, among our other successes, that we surpassed our expectations as well as consensus estimates. With the strong tailwinds we saw at the end of 2024 and into the start of 2025, we believe we are uniquely positioned to grow shareholder value by leveraging our industry leadership position in addressing pharma's most critical commercial challenges: improving brand visibility in an increasingly digital healthcare environment, reducing script abandonment rates, enhancing interoperability at the point of care, and supporting the shift toward complex specialty medications."" ""As the success of our ongoing transformation becomes more reflected in our financial results, now more than ever, we will be laser-focused on operational excellence and disciplined execution while ensuring we delight our customers and forge stronger relationships with valued business partners. Over the past few months, we have completed an extensive strategic review of the Company’s business processes, operations, revenue model, and growth plans and believe we are on the right path forward for shareholder value creation. As we move through fiscal 2025 and leverage the strong momentum we had in 2024, we plan to continue the Company’s growth and transformation, focusing very closely on customer-centricity and delight, continuing to expand our unique value proposition with pharma, positioning OptimizeRx to become a “Rule of 40 company,” and unlocking new opportunities for profitable revenue growth and shareholder value creation. A key component of our strategy includes transitioning our DAAP customers to a more predictable subscription-based model for data services, which we expect will improve margins, increase visibility, reduce the cyclical nature of our business, and facilitate our ability to more effectively scale."" Financial Highlights Financial Outlook The Company is providing full year 2025 guidance and expects revenue to be at least $100 million with an Adjusted EBITDA of at least $12 million.

The reasons why we believe these measures provide useful information to investors and, for historical periods, a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the supplemental tables that follow. Although the Company provides guidance for Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, it is not able to provide guidance to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Reconciliations for forward-looking figures would require unreasonable effort at this time because of the uncertainty and variability of the nature and amount of certain components of various necessary GAAP components, including, for example, those related to compensation, acquisition expenses, amortization or others that may arise during the year, and the Company’s management believes such reconciliations would imply a degree of precision that would be confusing or misleading to investors. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. **Definition of Key Performance Indicators Top 20 pharmaceutical manufacturers: We have updated the definition of “top 20 pharmaceutical manufacturers” in our key performance indicators to be based upon Fierce Pharma’s most updated list of “The top 20 pharma companies by 2023 revenue”. We previously used “The top 20 pharma companies by 2022 revenue”. As a result of this change, prior periods have been restated for comparative purposes. Net revenue retention: Net revenue retention is a comparison of revenue generated from all clients in the previous period to total revenue generated from the same clients in the following year (i.e., excludes new client relationships for the most recent year). Revenue per average full-time employee: We define revenue per average full-time employee (FTE) as total revenue over the last 12 months (LTM) divided by the average number of employees over the LTM, which is calculated by taking our total number of FTEs at the end of the prior year period by our total FTE headcount at the end of the most recent period. About OptimizeRx OptimizeRx is a leading healthcare technology company that’s redefining how life science brands connect with patients and healthcare providers.

OpenLight and Tower Semiconductor Demonstrate 400G/lane Modulators Built on Silicon Photonic Wafers for Data Centers and AI Optical Connectivity,"March 12, 2025 10:00 ET","Innovation paves the way for a high-volume, silicon photonics 400G/lane platform to meet next-generation 3.2T optical communication architectures for datacom and AI applications. SANTA CLARA, Calif., and MIGDAL HAEMEK, Israel, March 12 , 2025 — OpenLight, the world leader in custom PASIC chip design and manufacturing, and Tower Semiconductor (NASDAQ/TASE: TSEM), the leading foundry of high-value analog semiconductor solutions, today announced the successful demonstration of the 400G/lane modulator on Tower’s commercially available, integrated silicon photonics platform, PH18DA, achieving a better than 3.5db extinction ratio using the industry-standard PAM-4 modulation format and at a drive voltage of 0.6 volts peak-to-peak. The 400G demonstration is built using OpenLight’s IP on Tower’s existing silicon photonics platform already supporting customers at 100G and 200G/lane. The integrated silicon photonics demonstration is designed to support next-generation 400G/lane optical communication architectures, offering a scalable solution from 100G to 200G to 400G to fill the growing demand for high-speed data transfer in cloud computing, AI and ML applications. Operating at 400G per lane, across all four CWDM (Coarse Wavelength Division Multiplexing) wavelengths, this enables a commercially viable path for both DR8 and FR4 next-generation 3.2Tb solutions and beyond. Currently, pure silicon-based modulators are unable to support bit rates of 400G, pointing out a clear need for a cost-effective solution in the industry. For datacom and AI applications, including LPO and CPO, heterogeneous integrated based devices deliver significant advantages: small size, high bandwidth, low drive voltage and volume manufacturable on a silicon photonics platform. In addition to the heterogeneous integration of 400G modulators, lasers and optical amplifiers all on a single, compact, cost- and power-efficient photonic integrated circuit (PIC) are available on the platform. “Our partnership with Tower represents a critical step in the integration of advanced silicon photonics into the datacom landscape. The success of this demonstration sets the stage for groundbreaking advancements in high-speed networking,” said Dr. Adam Carter, CEO of OpenLight. “Utilizing our existing 200G heterogeneous modulator design, we have now future-proofed customers’ PASIC designs from 100G to 200G to 400G per lane, minimizing design, layout and time to market, as this 400G modulator is a drop-in replacement for existing 200G modulator PASIC designs. The other added benefit of using the same design is the proven high-reliability performance and the ability to use flip chip processes when packaging into an integrated optical sub-assembly.” “We’re pleased to collaborate with OpenLight, leveraging their cutting-edge silicon photonics technology to create a cost-effective approach to support 400G/lane. This is an extension of our PH18DA platform currently supporting customers at 100G and 200G/lane and now providing a robust solution for 400G/lane that is immediately ready for customer prototyping. This is a significant step toward providing scalable, reliable, high-performance and manufacturable solutions for the next generation of optical communication technology,” said Russell Ellwanger, CEO of Tower Semiconductor. “By utilizing Tower’s PH18DA platform, this collaboration allows OpenLight’s heterogeneous integration technology to provide a secure path to higher speeds without the need for complex and expensive integration alternatives like Thin Film Lithium Niobate (TFLN), BTO or polymers.” For more detailed information on this and OpenLight, please visit OpenLight at the OFC Conference on 1-3 April 2025, booth# 4231.

The allocation strategy may be suspended, discontinued or modified at any time for any reason.

"Crypto Cards Go Non-Custodial With GoDefi, Announces Second Funding Round Following Initial Launch Success","March 12, 2025 07:24 ET","Prague, Czech Republic , March  12, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- A centralized spending experience with decentralization at its core, GoDefi offers virtual debit cards that users can connect with their favorite crypto wallet. In a world where spending crypto in a regular TradFi environment means transferring assets to a centralized finance app, GoDefi is redefining using payment cards. Connecting with users’ wallets, GoDefi solution allows direct spending without the need to transfer crypto over to its app. With a successful beta stage with active and real people using their favorite crypto from everything to paying their rent to their morning coffee, GoDefi is planning to expand its wings. Debit Card, But With Self Custody While crypto payment solutions have bridged the traditional and DeFi world, these services break one essential rule of crypto: decentralization. GoDefi helps tap into the crypto population that is not comfortable with handing over their assets, but at the same time wishes to spend it. GoDefi’s app connects with several private wallets, both soft and hardware-based, but never requires crypto top-ups. The crypto remain in the users’ wallets up to the point where they spend with the Mastercard-powered GoDefi card. The assets are utilized directly, without GoDefi ever taking custody. Built on the Solana network, GoDefi’s services are fast, economical, and secure. Integrated with popular payment network MasterCard, GoDefi allows crypto holders the opportunity to spend their assets on millions of merchants, without ever handing over control of their wallets. Now, GoDefi is looking into expanding its services to other popular chains, as explained by GoDefi CTO and CoFounder, Sergei Burmisov, “Leveraging Solana’s cutting-edge architecture and our deep banking expertise, our tech team continues to explore additional blockchains and processing solutions to drive innovation even further. Our goal is to deeply integrate payment services into the DeFi ecosystem, allowing DeFi wallet users and lending protocol [Kamino, Save, AAVE, etc.] participants to utilize their assets for everyday needs without leaving the DeFi space.” Expansion And Global Audience GoDefi is successfully helping Solana network users spend and receive crypto without the need for tapping into fiat liquidity. GoDefi also believes in legal compliance and is fully licensed in the EU. With plans to go global, GoDefi aims to give access to more than 5 million crypto users and their $15 billion assets in the coming few years. The core mission is summed up by the Founder, Ilia Chernyshev, “...we are committed to a fully non-custodial approach, setting us apart from other crypto-payment solutions. Our mission is to seamlessly connect DeFi with the real world, delivering the best of both - security, usability, and an intuitive user experience. Our customers don’t need to top up a card or deposit funds elsewhere - their assets always securely stored in their own self-custody wallets.  In 2025, we are taking GoDefi global, aiming to fully replace legacy banking for those who embrace self-custody.” and,  “While decentralized finance can often feel complex, our goal is to make it as intuitive as the best traditional fintech services to lead the transition from TradFi to DeFi for mainstream users.” Next Funding Round On The Horizon GoDefi raised $2 million in its initial seed round last year. The funding helped the team develop and launch its innovative service, available on Web, Android, and iOS platforms. The limited release has seen an influx of users, showing GoDefi’s critical success and a clear demand for its services. With a global vision and multi-chain support this year, GoDefi is preparing to open its doors to more backers with a second funding round. The funding will help the project develop the services further, including popular blockchain support and global legal compliance. Overcoming the complexity often experienced in DeFi handling, the project aims to bring traditional fintech experience to DeFi, with a larger vision of onboarding fiat users to the world of crypto.

"ReversingLabs Annual Software Supply Chain Security Report Spotlights Mounting Attacks on AI, Crypto, Open Source, and Commercial Software","March 12, 2025 11:00 ET","CAMBRIDGE, Mass., March  12, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ReversingLabs (RL), the trusted name in file and software security, today released its third annual Software Supply Chain Security Report. The 2025 report details the growing sophistication of software supply chain attacks fueled by widespread flaws in open-source and third-party commercial software, along with malicious campaigns targeting AI and cryptocurrency development pipelines. According to RL data, open-source software remained a key element of supply chain risk in 2024. For example, incidents of exposed development secrets via publicly accessible, open-source packages rose 12% compared to 2023. And critical and exploitable software flaws continued to lurk in even the most widely used open-source packages. A scan of 30 open-source packages that account for more than 650 million total downloads across three leading open-source package managers found an average of 6 critical-severity and 33 high-severity flaws per package. But open-source software is just one source of software supply chain risk. A scan by RL of more than two dozen widely used commercial-software binaries, including commercial and open-source operating systems, password managers, web browsers, and virtual private network (VPN) software, found evidence of software risks lurking in third-party commercial binaries. Many of the packages scanned by RL received a failing security grade due to the discovery of exposed secrets, actively exploited software vulnerabilities, evidence of possible code tampering, and inadequate application hardening. “The 2025 report highlights the challenges faced by software vendors and their enterprise buyers,” said Mario Vuksan, Co-Founder and CEO of ReversingLabs. “First is the increasing sophistication of the attackers, and their willingness to invest years to plan and carry out their attacks. Second is the move beyond open source to target commercial software. This reinforces the need to establish better controls over the software we build and deploy. This is especially true with the rise of AI across the software supply chain.” Industry analyst firm Gartner underscored this need for focus in its Gartner Security & Risk Management Summit 2024 London, saying that the “security of the software supply chain is now as critical as the security of the software itself.” Additional key findings for the 2025 SSCRR report include: Third-Party Commercial Software Is Targeted and Exposed While much of the conversation about software supply chain security focuses on open-source software packages, the most prominent risks lie in closed-source, commercial software. To underscore this problem, RL scanned 20 distinct versions of VPN clients from six prominent vendors and found worrying trends including: Serious Risks Continue to Lurk in Open-Source PackagesWhile prominent risks lay in third-party commercial software, open-source software modules and code repositories still accounted for the vast majority of supply chain risks in 2024. RL identified serious, exploitable software flaws, configuration errors, and other problems lurking in widely used open-source modules, which present a significant risk. Additional examples of open-source risks include: Attacks on Crypto Apps Send Warnings for Software Producers2024 saw a parade of sophisticated software supply chain attacks targeting cryptocurrency exchanges, wallets, and end-user applications. The crypto-focused attackers employed sophisticated and high-touch techniques to gain access to sensitive cryptocurrency applications and infrastructure. The report outlines research on detected malicious code in an established Python package, aiocpa. Threats to AI Supply Chains are GrowingThe SSCS Report also documents a series of malicious software supply chain campaigns targeting development infrastructure and code used by developers of AI and large language model machine learning applications. RL researchers discovered a malicious technique dubbed “nullifAI” in which malicious code was placed in Pickle serialization files, while evading protections built into the Hugging Face open-source platform - a main resource for AI and ML developers.

Silberstein & Miklos P.C. (ASK4SAM) Expands Focus on Rideshare Accident Cases in Riverdale the Bronx: Specializing in Uber and Lyft Claims,"March 11, 2025 10:00 ET","BRONX, N.Y., March  11, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Silberstein & Miklos P.C., a trusted personal injury law firm, announces the expansion of its focus on rideshare accident cases in Riverdale and throughout the Bronx. Specializing in Uber and Lyft claims, the firm provides dedicated legal representation for victims seeking justice against negligent rideshare drivers, third-party motorists, and corporate entities. With extensive experience in personal injury law and rideshare liability, Silberstein & Miklos P C navigates the complexities of insurance disputes, liability determination, and compensation negotiations to secure the best possible outcomes for their clients.  ASK4SAM provides expert legal support for Uber and Lyft accident victims in Riverdale and The Bronx, fighting for maximum compensation. Legal assistance is critical in securing fair compensation for medical expenses, lost income, pain and suffering, and other damages arising from rideshare accidents. Silberstein & Miklos, P.C., offers strategic representation to individuals seeking justice after an Uber or Lyft accident. For a consultation, contact (718) 204-8000 or visit https://ask4sam.net/bronx. The firm’s expertise in handling personal injury claims ensures that victims receive the legal guidance necessary to navigate the complexities of rideshare accident litigation. Uber and Lyft accidents differ from standard car accidents due to the involvement of multiple insurance policies, corporate liability structures, and varying degrees of driver accountability. Legal complexities can arise when determining whether the driver was logged into the rideshare app, actively transporting a passenger, or waiting for a ride request. Silberstein & Miklos, P.C., has successfully handled cases involving disputed liability, policy exclusions, and inadequate settlement offers from insurance providers. The firm remains committed to holding negligent drivers and rideshare companies accountable for injuries sustained by passengers, pedestrians, cyclists, and other motorists. Rideshare accidents can be a complex process, often involving multiple parties accountable for the injuries sustained. A rideshare accident lawyer plays a crucial role in identifying the fault driver and determining whether the responsible party is the rideshare company, the individual driver, or a third-party motorist. Given the legal intricacies surrounding direct liability, accident victims benefit from experienced personal injury attorneys who can navigate the complexities of insurance claims, ensuring that the injured party receives full financial compensation for damages.  Silberstein & Miklos, P.C. on Google Maps A thorough investigation of the accident scene is essential in building a strong claim. Police reports, medical records, and witness statements provide critical evidence in proving negligence, whether due to distracted driving, traffic violations, or a rear-end collision. In many cases, rideshare companies may attempt to deny responsibility, shifting blame onto the fault party or relying on personal insurance limitations. Skilled accident lawyers fight to protect the rights of the injured person, ensuring that all legal avenues are explored. Beyond vehicle impact, bodily injury and visible injuries often require immediate and ongoing medical care. Seeking a medical exam soon after a rideshare collision is crucial, as certain conditions—such as internal trauma or spinal damage—may not present symptoms immediately. The cost of physical therapy, long-term rehabilitation, and other medical costs can quickly escalate, making it vital for victims to explore their legal options with qualified counsel. Compensation may cover property damage, lost wages, physical pain, and even punitive damages in cases of extreme negligence. The legal process for rideshare accidents involves filing claims against multiple entities, including corporate policies tied to rideshare services and personal insurance held by the driver. Navigating these overlapping policies requires the expertise of a rideshare accident lawyer, who can evaluate potential vehicle damage claims while ensuring victims receive the support necessary to recover. Free initial consultations with experienced legal professionals can help victims understand their rights, assess liability, and pursue the justice they deserve. Understanding Rideshare Accident Liability in New York Rideshare accidents introduce unique legal challenges that require an in-depth understanding of New York’s personal injury laws. Uber and Lyft classify their drivers as independent contractors, often complicating the claims process when victims seek compensation for injuries. Rideshare companies provide liability insurance coverage that varies depending on the driver's status at the time of the accident. If a driver is logged into the app but has not accepted a ride, contingent liability coverage applies, whereas full coverage is available when an active ride is in progress. Understanding these distinctions is crucial in maximizing financial recovery for injured victims. Silberstein & Miklos, P.C., thoroughly investigates each case to determine the appropriate liability coverage and pursue the maximum compensation available. The firm’s legal team works diligently to gather evidence, obtain witness statements, analyze accident reports, and negotiate with insurance companies to ensure that accident victims are not unjustly denied compensation. In cases involving severe injuries, permanent disabilities, or wrongful death, the firm fights for settlements that account for long-term medical care, rehabilitation costs, and emotional distress.

HUMAN Client-side Defense Integrates with Amazon Web Services Marketplace & Web Application Firewall to Simplify Compliance with New PCI DSS 4 Requirements,"March 11, 2025 10:00 ET","NEW YORK, March  11, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- HUMAN Security, Inc., a leading cybersecurity company committed to safeguarding every step of the customer’s online journey by defending against bots, fraud, and digital risk, today announced that it is integrating its Client-side Defense with the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Marketplace and Web Application Firewall (WAF). This will provide an easy way to comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard— known as PCI DSS 4—consumer browser requirements 6.4.3 and 11.6.1 that took effect in March 2025. “HUMAN’s long-standing partnership with AWS emphasizes our commitment to deliver the next-gen suite of solutions that constitute a modern Client-side Defense,” said Elad Amit, SVP, Enterprise Product.  “The integration between HUMAN Security Client-side Defense and AWS WAF allows quick authorization, justification, and reporting so that compliance teams can protect their customers' card data under these new PCI DSS 4 requirements.” Any merchant accepting payment cards to purchase goods and services must comply with PCI DSS 4. The two new PCI DSS 4 controls require entities to manage and monitor scripts and security-impacting HTTP headers deployed on their payment pages, pages that embed payment pages, or forms fully outsourced to third parties. With the new integration, customers can comply with these requirements from within AWS WAF while continuing to configure AWS WAF rules to allow, block, or monitor (count) web requests based on IP addresses, HTTP headers, HTTP body, URI strings, SQL injection, and cross-site scripting. HUMAN Client-side Defense makes it easy to comply with these requirements during the initial deployment and for the expected ongoing security activities. Integrating with AWS allows customers who purchase Client-side Defense to click within the WAF console to log into the HUMAN Defense Platform, simplifying the customer journey, protecting their payment pages, and enabling compliance with the new requirements. Additional capabilities this integration offers include: HUMAN customers using Client-side Defense include major airlines, leading online travel planning and booking platforms, and e-commerce platforms. A CISO from Top 5 Global Airline said: “The solution pays for itself by reducing our risk from client-side data breaches and helping us avoid fines and the subsequent negative impact to our brand reputation.” A Senior Security Developer, Information Security Team, at Priceline said: “HUMAN is a fantastic solution for managing business critical scripts, and addressing the new PCI DSS 4 requirements (6.4.3 & 11.6.1) with ease. It not only adds another layer of defense to our overall security posture but helps my team prioritize and reduces the need for time-intensive manual investigations and record-keeping activities.” About HUMANHUMAN is a leading cybersecurity company committed to protecting the integrity of the digital world. We ensure that every digital interaction, transaction, and connection is authentic, secure, and human. Our Human Defense Platform safeguards the entire customer journey with high-fidelity decision-making that defends against bots, fraud, and digital threats.

Survey: Nearly one-third of employees have felt excluded or marginalized at work in the last five years,"March 12, 2025 09:00 ET","NEW YORK, March  12, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Traliant, a leader in online compliance training, today released its latest study, “The Inclusion Report: Traliant’s Inclusivity Pulse Survey.” Based on responses from over 500 full-time U.S. employees, the study examines inclusion today and how organizations can create environments where all employees feel valued, engaged and empowered to contribute to sustainable success. The report found that a majority of employers and employees prioritize inclusion as a critical driver of retention, innovation and business performance. However, findings reveal a gap between intent and impact: while many employers recognize the importance of inclusion, nearly a third (31%) of employees reported feeling excluded or marginalized at work in the past five years. “Inclusion efforts rooted in anti‑discrimination practices are legal and necessary for organizations to make employees feel valued, engaged and empowered to contribute to the long-term growth and resiliency,” said Casey Heck, Senior Vice President of HR at Traliant. “By identifying and addressing gaps in workplace culture that cause some employees to feel excluded, businesses can strengthen workplace collaboration to realize the full potential of their workforce in achieving business goals.” The report reinforces the need for organizations to prioritize anti-discriminatory training that meets the requirements of the new administration and provides employees and managers with the skills to build an inclusive environment that fosters improved workplace decision-making, workflows and trust.

"Crypto Cards Go Non-Custodial With GoDefi, Announces Second Funding Round Following Initial Launch Success","March 11, 2025 09:35 ET","Prague, Czech Republic , March  11, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- o Cards Go Non-Custodial With GoDefi, Announces Second Funding Round Following Initial Launch Success  Prague, Czech Republic Mar 10, 2025 (Premium) A centralized spending experience with decentralization at its core, GoDefi offers virtual debit cards that users can connect with their favorite crypto wallet. In a world where spending crypto in a regular TradFi environment means transferring assets to a centralized finance app, GoDefi is redefining using payment cards. Connecting with users’ wallets, GoDefi solution allows direct spending without the need to transfer crypto over to its app. With a successful beta stage with active and real people using their favorite crypto from everything to paying their rent to their morning coffee, GoDefi is planning to expand its wings. Debit Card, But With Self Custody While crypto payment solutions have bridged the traditional and DeFi world, these services break one essential rule of crypto: decentralization. GoDefi helps tap into the crypto population that is not comfortable with handing over their assets, but at the same time wishes to spend it. GoDefi’s app connects with several private wallets, both soft and hardware-based, but never requires crypto top-ups. The crypto remain in the users’ wallets up to the point where they spend with the Mastercard-powered GoDefi card. The assets are utilized directly, without GoDefi ever taking custody. Built on the Solana network, GoDefi’s services are fast, economical, and secure. Integrated with popular payment network MasterCard, GoDefi allows crypto holders the opportunity to spend their assets on millions of merchants, without ever handing over control of their wallets. Now, GoDefi is looking into expanding its services to other popular chains, as explained by GoDefi CTO and CoFounder, Sergei Burmisov, “Leveraging Solana’s cutting-edge architecture and our deep banking expertise, our tech team continues to explore additional blockchains and processing solutions to drive innovation even further. Our goal is to deeply integrate payment services into the DeFi ecosystem, allowing DeFi wallet users and lending protocol [Kamino, Save, AAVE, etc.] participants to utilize their assets for everyday needs without leaving the DeFi space.” Expansion And Global Audience GoDefi is successfully helping Solana network users spend and receive crypto without the need for tapping into fiat liquidity. GoDefi also believes in legal compliance and is fully licensed in the EU. With plans to go global, GoDefi aims to give access to more than 5 million crypto users and their $15 billion assets in the coming few years. The core mission is summed up by the Founder, Ilia Chernyshev, “...we are committed to a fully non-custodial approach, setting us apart from other crypto-payment solutions. Our mission is to seamlessly connect DeFi with the real world, delivering the best of both - security, usability, and an intuitive user experience. Our customers don’t need to top up a card or deposit funds elsewhere - their assets always securely stored in their own self-custody wallets.  In 2025, we are taking GoDefi global, aiming to fully replace legacy banking for those who embrace self-custody.” and,  “While decentralized finance can often feel complex, our goal is to make it as intuitive as the best traditional fintech services to lead the transition from TradFi to DeFi for mainstream users.” Next Funding Round On The Horizon GoDefi raised $2 million in its initial seed round last year. The funding helped the team develop and launch its innovative service, available on Web, Android, and iOS platforms. The limited release has seen an influx of users, showing GoDefi’s critical success and a clear demand for its services. With a global vision and multi-chain support this year, GoDefi is preparing to open its doors to more backers with a second funding round. The funding will help the project develop the services further, including popular blockchain support and global legal compliance. Overcoming the complexity often experienced in DeFi handling, the project aims to bring traditional fintech experience to DeFi, with a larger vision of onboarding fiat users to the world of crypto.

Proto Presents Real-Time Spatial Communication for the Deaf at CSUN Assistive Technologies Conference,"March 11, 2025 16:15 ET","Los Angles, CA, March  11, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Proto Inc., original hologram and spatial compute platform, will present at the CSUN Assistive Technology Conference, explaining why its 3D platform makes for richer interactions using ASL and other sign languages – and can improve experiences for the Deaf and hard of hearing in all kinds of public situations. The conference takes place at the Anaheim Marriott and runs from March 10th to 14th. “Real Time Spatial Communication for The Deaf” will be presented by Proto Hologram’s Brittany Barry  on Thursday, March 13th at 11:20 AM Brittany Barry, who serves in Proto’s Business Development department with an emphasis on events and special projects, uses ASL to communicate daily and will deliver a compelling presentation on how Proto’s technology is bridging communication gaps, enhancing expression and improving experiences in public spaces with AI Hologram concierges. “Deaf individuals often experience isolation due to communication barriers. Traditional solutions like texting and video relay services (VRS) lack the full expressiveness of sign language,” Barry explains. “Proto is revolutionizing this space by enabling life-size holographic projections that facilitate real-time, natural conversations without intermediaries.”  Appearing in Proto Hologram devices, company Founder and Chairman David Nussbaum gets ASL interpretation from Brittany Barry.  Revolutionizing Assistive Communication Proto Hologram’s cutting-edge 3D technology is poised to transform how Deaf individuals engage with the world around them. Unlike conventional 2D video services that can cause eye strain and limit clarity in sign language, Proto’s 3D holograms present interpreters and signers in a fully immersive space. This innovation enhances conversational clarity, reduces fatigue for both Deaf users and interpreters, and creates an experience akin to in-person communication. During the presentation, Barry will explore Proto’s integration into key sectors such as: Proto has been tested by Gallaudet University for ASL communications. Dr. Laurene E. Simms, Chief Bilingual Officer at Gallaudet University, has said of the technology: “This is a dream come true for me personally and for the deaf community. For so long, we have been eager to utilize ASL and English bilingualism through hologram technology, which allows us to fully express ourselves in ASL, a spatial language.” Pioneering the Future of Accessibility In addition to its current applications, Proto is developing new accessibility-driven features, including: - Horizontal Displays: Designed to optimize sign language communication, allowing multiple signers to appear simultaneously with more expressive space.- Live Captioning: A groundbreaking feature that will enable real-time captions on all live holographic projections, ensuring seamless accessibility for all users.- SignLLM AI Integration: A pioneering AI system that interprets and generates sign language gestures, allowing for fully interactive sign language communication with Proto’s AI holograms. “If You Can’t Be There, Beam There” Barry’s presentation will reinforce Proto’s commitment to creating equitable solutions for the Deaf community. “Everyday locations like hospitals, schools, and airports were not built with accessibility in mind. Proto is changing that,” she states. “This technology ensures that Deaf individuals no longer have to rely solely on intermediaries but can interact directly and authentically.” David Nussbaum, Founder and Chairman of Proto Hologram said, “My goal with Proto has always been to bring people together across any divides that might separate them – and to find other ways to make life easier that people just assume are in some science fiction future but that we can make happen now. So our efforts in assistive technology and sign language are especially satisfying. We’re very lucky to have Brittany helping develop our work in this area.” If you’re interested in an in person or remote Proto Hologram demonstration, or for photos or videos, contact: owen@protohologram.com About Proto Inc.: Proto Inc. is the patented leader in hologram technology and AI spatial compute.

"Smart Bot for the Easy Life: ANTHBOT Genie Launches, Revolutionizing the AI-Powered Lawn Care","March 12, 2025 11:00 ET","Singapore, March  12, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lawn maintenance has long been a time-consuming and labor-intensive task, demanding hours of mowing, trimming, and upkeep. For many homeowners, this means sacrificing valuable weekends, but who has the patience (or energy) for all that? Weekends should be for sleeping in, binge-watching shows, or just doing nothing at all. Recognizing this challenge, ANTHBOT is proud to announce the official launch of ANTHBOT Genie, an advanced AI-powered robotic mower designed to revolutionize lawn care.  With ANTHBOT Genie, homeowners can now experience a fully autonomous, intelligent lawn care solution that takes over every aspect of maintenance—analyzing, optimizing, and managing the yard with precision. This groundbreaking technology allows users to reclaim their time while ensuring their lawn remains in perfect condition, effortlessly. Genie transforms lawn care into a seamless, hands-free experience, making weekends truly about relaxation and enjoyment. Say Goodbye to Lawn Care Hassles – Let Genie Handle EverythingActing as a true AI gardening assistant, Genie creates personalized, science-backed care plans tailored to the season, weather, timing, and your lawn's unique needs.  No more spending weekends pushing a mower, tweaking schedules, or hiring a gardener—Genie takes over entirely, saving you both time and labor costs while keeping your yard immaculate.  Revolutionary AI Meets Lawn Care: Discover the Unmatched Features of ANTHBOT GenieImagine waking up on a weekend morning, stepping into your backyard with a cup of coffee in hand, and seeing a perfectly manicured lawn—without lifting a finger. No noise, no hassle, no sweat. That’s the experience ANTHBOT Genie delivers. It keeps your lawn ready for any moment—be it a picnic, a gathering, or simply unwinding outdoors. Set It Up in Minutes, Enjoy a Perfect Lawn InstantlyWith just a single tap on the mobile app, Genie runs on your lawn, maps the boundaries, and calculates the most efficient mowing route—all within minutes. With zero setup effort and no technical skills required, even first-time users can get started effortlessly. Unbox, tap, and let Genie handle the rest.  Stability, Unstoppable and Precision Performance—A Lawn Mower That Truly Understands Your YardIts Full-Band RTK technology delivers 10x the signal strength and refresh rate of standard mowers. With 1,040 baseband channels, Genie maintains rock-solid connectivity even near buildings, under trees, or in bad weather.Meanwhile, after mapping your lawn, its built-in AI algorithm instantly calculates the most efficient mowing route based on your yard’s layout and the charging station’s position. Using a highly efficient U-shaped pattern, Genie ensures complete coverage with minimal overlap, maximizing battery life and delivering a perfectly manicured lawn with every pass. Conquer Slopes with Confidence – Built for Any TerrainAnd what about terrain? Many homeowners hesitate to invest in robotic mowers because their lawns aren’t perfectly flat. Slopes, bumps, and thick patches of grass often spell disaster for conventional models, leaving homeowners to intervene and manually rescue their machines. Genie, however, is different. Featured with a powerful motor and an ultra-low center of gravity, it can easily climb slopes up to 45% (24°).  It glides smoothly over uneven ground, navigating thick grass and unexpected obstacles without hesitation.  Next-Level Obstacle Avoidance: 3D Vision for Ultimate SafetyMost robotic mowers rely on just one or two cameras—Genie is the only mower equipped with  4 high-resolution cameras, offering a 300° ultra-wide field of view. Powered by an AI vision model trained on 100,000+ real-world obstacles, Genie recognizes and avoids 1,000+ types of objects in real time—from garden hoses to kids’ toys.It always detects the obstacles within a blink in case of collision. As is often the case, if a robotic mower collides with an object in its blind spot, it typically gets stuck and cannot move. Unlike others, Genie’s 360° collision sensor will response to the stuff and change its direction to move on after contact. Therefore, the 3D Vision and 360° collision sensor double the security, protecting your furniture, decorations, and personal assets. Even though the visibility is in bad condition, Genie always moves around the obstacles with precision smoothly. A Lawn That Cares: Protecting Hedgehogs and WildlifeTraditional robotic mowers can pose a risk to small animals like hedgehogs, which curl into a ball when threatened, making them hard to avoid. In response, ANTHBOT Genie features a specialized algorithm trained to recognize hedgehog-like shapes and behaviors, reducing the risk of harm. Smooth, Smart, and Eco-Friendly Lawn Care – Tailored to Your NeedsWith ANTHBOT Genie, lawn maintenance is quiet, efficient, and eco-friendly. Unlike noisy traditional mowers, Genie operates at a low sound level, letting you enjoy your yard undisturbed. Genie features two user-controlled speed modes—Normal and Efficient. And its intelligent blade system raises or lowers the cutting deck when encountering obstacles like uneven terrain. Beyond quiet performance, Genie is also an environmentally friendly choice. Powered by a high-capacity 10,000mAh lithium battery, it produces zero emissions, making your outdoor space cleaner and greener.

Through this collaboration, SAIC will integrate Defense Unicorns’ Unicorn Delivery Service (UDS) into its existing, robust software delivery ecosystem, streamlining how SAIC deploys and maintains applications across cloud, on-premises and tactical edge environments – ultimately improving operational readiness for today’s warfighters. The DoD relies on software to support mission-critical operations across all domains, and traditional software delivery methods often result in fragmented, slow and complex processes.

This allows software teams to field mission-ready applications more efficiently and reduce software delivery timelines from months down to weeks or days. “SAIC is committed to providing our customers an innovative, integrated ecosystem of proven next-generation offerings and strategic partnerships that meet their unique mission needs and accelerate mission outcomes,” said Bob Ritchie, SAIC Chief Technology Officer. “By leveraging UDS, we are reducing complexity and ensuring the government can rapidly and consistently deploy secure, scalable software applications across diverse and challenging operational environments.” With a shared focus to advancing defense technology, SAIC and Defense Unicorns are fundamentally changing how the DoD fields mission-critical software. UDS automates deployment, accelerates compliance and removes integration barriers – ensuring that software updates and new capabilities are delivered without unnecessary delays. “This partnership is a game-changer for the DoD. By integrating SAIC’s mission expertise with the automation and security of UDS, we are revolutionizing how software is delivered at scale,” said Rob Slaughter, Defense Unicorns Chief Executive Officer. “Together, we are enabling warfighters to access the latest capabilities when and where they need them.” SAIC brings more than 50 years of experience in technology integration for government customers, extensive defense industry relationships and the operational expertise to scale UDS across complex programs. By bridging the gap between innovative technology and real-world mission requirements, SAIC and Defense Unicorns are enabling a faster, more secure and scalable approach to software delivery that meets the evolving needs of national defense. As this partnership expands, its impact will extend across multiple defense programs, creating a repeatable and high-velocity software delivery model that enhances DoD modernization efforts.
