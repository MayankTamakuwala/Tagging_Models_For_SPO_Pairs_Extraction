Clene Demonstrates Strengthened ALS Survival Benefit with CNM-Au8® Treatment,"March 12, 2025 08:00 ET","SALT LAKE CITY, March  12, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Clene, Inc. (Nasdaq: CLNN) and its subsidiary, Clene Nanomedicine, Inc., a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on revolutionizing the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and multiple sclerosis (MS), today announced new evidence from a cross-regimen, post hoc analysis of long-term survival in HEALEY ALS Platform Trial participants. The analyses further substantiate that treatment with CNM-Au8® 30 mg delivers a significant survival benefit for people living with ALS. New Survival AnalysesThe analyses compared survival in participants who received CNM-Au8 30 mg (Regimen C) to those of Regimen A in the HEALEY ALS Platform Trial. Regimen A provided a large concurrent control group vs. CNM-Au8 treatment using the same randomization criteria established within the HEALEY master protocol. Long-term survival status, determined through public records and site reporting, was evaluated over a follow-up period of up to 48 months. 78% of participants across both groups received standard ALS background therapy (riluzole, edaravone, or both) at baseline. These results are consistent with previous survival benefits observed in the HEALEY ALS Platform Trial’s 24-week double-blind period, the open-label extension of the Phase 2 RESCUE-ALS trial, and analyses of Expanded Access Programs compared to ALS natural history controls. “We are highly encouraged by these results, as the significant survival advantage demonstrated by CNM-Au8 not only reinforces its potential to extend life for people living with ALS but also validates our strategic direction as we prepare for the launch of our confirmatory Phase 3 RESTORE-ALS study in mid-2025,” stated Rob Etherington, President and CEO of Clene. “We look forward to discussing these findings with the FDA as we advance toward commercialization.” Merit Cudkowicz, M.D., M.S.c., Principal Investigator and sponsor of the HEALEY ALS Platform Trial, director of the Sean M. Healey & AMG Center for ALS, and executive director of the Mass General Brigham Neuroscience Institute, said, “The innovative design of the HEALEY ALS Platform Trial has enabled us to extract clear and meaningful survival data that helps make decisions about CNM-Au8 drug development.” About Regimen ARegimen A was one of the first three regimens investigated in the HEALEY ALS Platform Trial. Eligible participants were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive active treatment or matching placebo for a planned duration of 24 weeks. Participants assigned to Regimen A had to receive both quadrivalent and serotype B meningococcal vaccinations at least 14 days prior to the first dose of study drug, and participants were excluded from Regimen A if they had a history of meningococcal disease or prior treatment with a complement inhibitor. Regimen A was stopped prematurely for futility after all participants had been randomized, and approximately 70% had completed the Week 24 visit. Participants were instructed to discontinue study dosing, and a final early termination study visit was conducted. Long-term survival status of Regimen A participants was tracked from public records and site reporting independently of the early termination. There was no difference in long-term survival in participants randomized to Regimen A active compared to Regimen A placebo, supporting the combined analyses of the entire Regimen A population for comparisons of long-term survival to CNM-Au8 30 mg (Regimen C) participants.

We completed our commercial strategy realignment, which generated promising sequential growth of dispensed applicator units of YCANTH while simultaneously implementing significant cost reductions across the organization. We also continued advancing our late-stage clinical programs in basal cell carcinoma and common warts,” said Dr. Jayson Rieger, PhD, MBA, President and Chief Executive Officer of Verrica. Rieger continued “We successfully raised equity capital in the fourth quarter to strengthen our balance sheet and allow us to remain focused on commercial execution and development of our clinical assets.” “Based on achieving these early milestones, I believe Verrica is now on track to successfully execute our turnaround strategy. Our goal is to generate cash positive monthly operating results by the end of 2025. To achieve this, our focus will remain to establish YCANTH as the standard of care for the treatment of molluscum contagiosum. In parallel, we will work to create significant additional value by advancing our late-stage pipeline. We recently reported positive data from our Phase 2 study of our oncolytic peptide candidate, VP-315, for the treatment of basal cell carcinoma, and we also anticipate advancing VP-102 (YCANTH) into a Phase 3 clinical trial for the treatment of common warts as early as mid-2025.

Specifically, we continued to capture efficient branded revenue in the U.S. market for VASCEPA, unlocked access to VASCEPA/VAZKEPA in six additional global markets -- including Italy, China and Australia -- both on our own and through partnerships, and progressed in an additional 16 countries at various stages towards commercialization. The global VASCEPA franchise remains poised to continue expanding its impact on cardiovascular disease for at-risk patients worldwide.” In addition, Aaron Berg commented, “Building on our efforts and results in 2024, we continue to identify steps to advance the company. As a publicly traded company, there is considerable value in maintaining our Nasdaq listing. To this effect, today we announced our intent to initiate a ratio change to our ADS program.” 1-For-20 ADS Ratio Change In a separate press release issued today, the Company announced its intent to effect a Ratio Change on its American Depositary Shares (“ADS”) from one (1) ADS representing one (1) ordinary share, to the new ratio of one (1) ADS representing twenty (20) ordinary shares (the ""Ratio Change""). The effective date of the Ratio Change is expected to be on or about April 11, 2025. The objective of the Ratio Change is to maintain the Company’s listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market and to preserve the Company’s long-term access to the equity capital markets. For further information, please refer to the press release issued on March 12, 2025. Additional questions and answers regarding the Ratio Change can be found under the Investor Relations section of Amarin’s corporate web site here: https://cms.amarincorp.com/sites/default/files/2025-03/e6713d4c-9083-4623-a9e9-6b13d8a4201b.pdf Fourth Quarter 2024 & Recent Operational Highlights The Company continued to advance commercialization and pricing and reimbursement efforts across European markets: Through partnerships, the Company continues to make progress towards regulatory approvals, access and commercialization in Rest of World (RoW) markets: The Company’s R&D Team and other investigators have continued to generate, present and publish important new data which add to the significant body of evidence demonstrating the unique benefits of VASCEPA/VAZKEPA. In 2024, a total of 45 additional publications including abstracts, posters, and manuscripts were presented or published that, both individually and in aggregate, helped to advance an ever-broadening understanding of the science and value of icosapent ethyl and EPA. Fourth Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights Total net revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2024 was $62.3 million, compared to $74.7 million in the corresponding period of 2023, a decrease of 17%. Net product revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2024 was $60.1 million, compared to $70.6 million in the corresponding period of 2023, a decrease of 15%. This decrease was driven primarily by a lower net selling price due to US generic competition as well as a reduction in volume primarily related to an exclusive account no longer covering VASCEPA. Cost of goods sold, excluding non-cash inventory restructuring of $36.5 million, for the three months ended December 31, 2024 was $35.4 million, compared to $29.6 million in the corresponding period of 2023. Excluding the non-cash inventory restructuring charge in the three months ended December 31, 2024, gross margin was 41% and 58%, respectively. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2024 were $37.0 million, compared to $43.9 million in the corresponding period of 2023. This decrease primarily reflects the impact of ongoing cost optimization efforts across the business, first initiated by the Company in 2023. Research and development expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2024 were $6.0 million, compared to $5.8 million in the corresponding period of 2023. Under U.S. GAAP, the Company reported net loss of $48.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2024, or basic and diluted loss per share of $0.12. For the three months ended December 31, 2023, the Company reported net loss of $5.8 million, or basic and diluted loss per share of $0.01. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding non-cash stock-based compensation expense and restructuring charges, adjusted net loss for the three months ended December 31, 2024 was $8.7 million or adjusted basic and diluted loss per share of $0.02, compared with an adjusted net loss of $0.9 million or adjusted basic and diluted loss per share of $0.00 for the three months ended December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2024, the Company reported aggregate cash and investments of $294.2 million, compared to aggregate cash and investment of $320.7 million as of December 31, 2023. 2025 Strategic Outlook The Company is committed to capitalizing on the significant opportunity in Europe, while continuing to explore all strategies to accelerate growth in the region where there remains significant untapped potential, including more than 5 million high-risk patients with established cardiovascular disease in Europe, efficiently generating revenue and maximizing cash generation in the U.S., and from the RoW income stream. The Company continues to tightly manage its operating expenses and its cash position. The Company reaffirms its belief that current cash and investments and other assets are adequate to support continuing operations for the foreseeable future. The Company continues to explore and be open to all opportunities to get VASCEPA/VAZKEPA into the hands of as many at-risk patients as possible around the world.

Acumen Pharmaceuticals to Present During International Conference on Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s Diseases 2025 and American Academy of Neurology Annual Meeting,"March 12, 2025 08:00 ET","NEWTON, Mass., March  12, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Acumen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: ABOS), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a novel therapeutic that targets soluble amyloid beta oligomers (AβOs) for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), today announced upcoming scientific presentations at the International Conference on Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s Diseases and Related Neurological Disorders (AD/PD) in Vienna, Austria from April 1-5, 2025, and the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) Annual Meeting in San Diego, Calif., from April 5-9, 2025. Oral presentations will focus on implementation of a validated research-use plasma pTau217 assay in the clinical trial participant screening process. Poster presentations will focus on methods of interrogating the binding of AβOs to a model of human neurons; methods to more accurately assess the AβO selectivity of nonclinical assays and sabirnetug; and early effects of sabirnetug on synaptic biomarkers in AD. Together, these presentations support the comprehensive development program for sabirnetug, which Acumen is advancing as a potential next-generation antibody treatment for early symptomatic AD. AD/PD presentation details are as follows: Oral Presentation ALTITUDE-AD: Use of Plasma pTau217 Screening in An Ongoing Phase 2 Study of Sabirnetug for Early Symptomatic Alzheimer's Disease (2813) Poster Presentations Protocol for the Preparation of Stable Monomeric Amyloid Beta (1522) Utility of Human iPSC-Derived Neuronal Model for Evaluating Synaptic Binding of Amyloid Βeta Oligomers (1393) AAN presentation details are as follows: Oral Presentation ALTITUDE-AD: Use of Plasma pTau217 Assay to Screen Potential Participants in an Ongoing Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Phase 2 Study of Sabirnetug for Early Alzheimer's Disease (3870) Poster Presentation INTERCEPT-AD Biomarker Results: Early effect of sabirnetug treatment on synaptic biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease (3984) About Sabirnetug (ACU193) Sabirnetug (ACU193) is a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) discovered and developed based on its selectivity for soluble amyloid beta oligomers (AβOs), which are a highly toxic and pathogenic form of Aβ, relative to Aβ monomers and amyloid plaques. Soluble AβOs have been observed to be potent neurotoxins that bind to neurons, inhibit synaptic function and induce neurodegeneration. By selectively targeting toxic soluble AβOs, sabirnetug aims to address the hypothesis that soluble AβOs are an early and persistent underlying cause of the neurodegenerative process in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Sabirnetug has been granted Fast Track designation for the treatment of early AD by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and is currently being evaluated in a Phase 2 study in patients with early AD. About ALTITUDE-AD (Phase 2) Initiated in 2024, ALTITUDE-AD is a Phase 2, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sabirnetug (ACU193) infusions administered once every four weeks in slowing cognitive and functional decline as compared to placebo in participants with early Alzheimer's disease. The study will enroll approximately 540 individuals with early Alzheimer’s disease (mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to AD). The global study is currently ongoing at multiple investigative sites located in the United States, Canada, UK, and the European Union. More information can be found on www.clinicaltrials.gov, NCT identifier NCT06335173. About Acumen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Acumen Pharmaceuticals is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a novel therapeutic that targets toxic soluble amyloid beta oligomers (AβOs) for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Acumen’s scientific founders pioneered research on AβOs, which a growing body of evidence indicates are early and persistent triggers of Alzheimer’s disease pathology.

Lyell Immunopharma Reports Business Highlights and Financial Results for the Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024,"March 11, 2025 16:05 ET","SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., March  11, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lyell Immunopharma, Inc. (Nasdaq: LYEL), a clinical-stage company advancing a pipeline of next-generation CAR T-cell therapies for patients with cancer, today reported financial results and business highlights for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2024. “Last year was transformative for Lyell and now, based on promising emerging clinical data, we are poised to initiate pivotal development of IMPT-314, our next-generation dual-targeting CD19‌/‌CD20 CAR T-cell product candidate for patients with aggressive large B‑cell lymphoma,” said Lynn Seely, M.D., Lyell’s President and CEO. “We believe IMPT-314 has the potential to deliver improved outcomes for patients by increasing complete response rates and prolonging the duration of response over approved CD19 CAR T-cell therapies, and this year we expect to share more mature data from the ongoing Phase 1/2 trial of IMPT-314. We also plan to initiate two pivotal programs for IMPT-314: one for patients in the 3rd line and later setting by the middle of this year and a second program for patients in the 2nd line setting by early 2026. In addition, we expect to submit a new IND in 2026 for a next-generation solid tumor CAR T-cell product candidate with a new target that is fully-armed with a suite of technologies, including our proprietary clinically-validated anti-exhaustion technology. Our strong cash position enables us to advance our pipeline through important clinical milestones and fund operations into 2027.” Fourth Quarter Updates and Recent Business Highlights Lyell is advancing a pipeline of next-generation CAR T-cell product candidates. Its lead program, IMPT-314, is in Phase 1/2 clinical development for relapsed or refractory aggressive large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) and its preclinical programs target solid tumor indications. Lyell’s programs target cancers with large unmet need with substantial patient populations. IMPT-314: A next-generation dual-targeting CD19/CD20 CAR T-cell product candidate designed to increase complete response rates and prolong the duration of response as compared to the approved CD19‑targeted CAR T-cell therapies for the treatment of LBCL IMPT-314 is an autologous CAR T-cell product candidate with a true ‘OR’ logic gate to target B cells that express either CD19 or CD20 with full potency and is manufactured with a process that enriches for CD62L+ cells to generate more naïve and central memory CAR T cells with enhanced stemlike features and antitumor activity. The ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial is a multi-center, open-label study designed to evaluate the tolerability and clinical benefit of IMPT-314 in patients with relapsed/refractory LBCL and determine a recommended Phase 2 dose. IMPT-314 has received Fast Track Designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of relapsed/refractory aggressive B-cell lymphoma in the 3rd line and later (3rd line+) setting. Preclinical Pipeline, Technologies and Manufacturing Protocols Corporate Updates Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Financial Results Lyell reported a net loss of $191.9 million and $343.0 million for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2024, respectively, compared to a net loss of $52.9 million and $234.6 million for the same periods in 2023.

Balance Sheet Data: Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement our financial results and guidance presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we present non-GAAP net loss, non-GAAP R&D expenses and non-GAAP G&A expenses. Non‑GAAP net loss and non-GAAP R&D expenses exclude non-cash stock-based compensation expense and non-cash expenses related to the change in the estimated fair value of success payment liabilities from GAAP net loss and GAAP R&D expenses. Non-GAAP net loss further adjusts non-cash acquired IPR&D expense, non‑cash long-lived asset impairment expense and non‑cash investment gains and charges, as applicable. Non‑GAAP G&A expenses exclude non-cash stock-based compensation expense from GAAP G&A expenses. We believe that these non‑GAAP financial measures, when considered together with our financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, can enhance investors’ and analysts’ ability to meaningfully compare our results from period to period, and to identify operating trends in our business. We have excluded stock-based compensation expense, changes in the estimated fair value of success payment liabilities, acquired IPR&D expense, long-lived asset impairment expense and non-cash investment gains and charges from our non‑GAAP financial measures because they are non-cash gains and charges that may vary significantly from period to period as a result of changes not directly or immediately related to the operational performance for the periods presented. We also regularly use these non‑GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage and evaluate our business and to make operating decisions. These non-GAAP financial measures are in addition to, and not a substitute for or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non‑GAAP financial measures have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and, therefore, have limits in their usefulness to investors. We encourage investors to carefully consider our results under GAAP, as well as our supplemental non-GAAP financial information, to more fully understand our business.

OSE Immunotherapeutics and GERCOR Announce Positive Topline Phase 2 Result for Clinical Trial TEDOPaM Evaluating OSE2101 (Tedopi®) in Advanced Pancreatic Cancer,"March 11, 2025 13:00 ET","OSE Immunotherapeutics and GERCOR Announce Positive Topline Phase 2 Result for Clinical Trial TEDOPaM Evaluating OSE2101 (Tedopi®) in Advanced Pancreatic Cancer NANTES, France – March 11, 6:00pm CET - OSE Immunotherapeutics SA (ISIN: FR0012127173; Mnemo: OSE) and the GERCOR Group today announced that the primary endpoint has been reached in TEDOPaM (GERCOR D17-01 PRODIGE 63 trial), a Phase 2 clinical trial sponsored and conducted by the French GERCOR Oncology Clinician Group, evaluating OSE2101 (Tedopi®), the ‘off-the-shelf’ neoepitope-based therapeutic cancer vaccine, in advanced or metastatic Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC). TEDOPaM is a randomized, non-comparative, Phase 2 trial evaluating FOLFIRI1 (Arm A) and cancer vaccine OSE2101 (Tedopi®) plus FOLFIRI chemotherapy (Arm B) as maintenance treatment in HLA-A2 positive patients with PDAC with no progression after eight cycles of FOLFIRINOX induction chemotherapy2. The primary endpoint of the trial was the one-year overall survival (OS) rate in the experimental Arm B (Fleming 2-stage design, H0: 25%; H1: 50%, 1-sided alpha: 2.5%, power: 90%). 107 patients were enrolled with a 1:1 ratio. The TEDOPaM trial met its primary objective, showing positive outcomes according to the predefined statistical hypothesis, with minimal toxicity for OSE2101 (Tedopi®) combined with FOLFIRI as maintenance treatment. Further follow-up and translational analyses are ongoing, with detailed results to be presented at upcoming medical congresses. Prof. Cindy Neuzillet, MD, PhD (Curie cancer research Institute, Saint-Cloud), Principal Investigator of the TEDOPaM study: “These are positive results in a non-comparative trial. That said, we need to better understand the contribution of Tedopi® in the context of this combination. A large translational program on tumor tissue, blood, and imaging is ongoing. Additional analysis at a longer time point will also be necessary for more mature survival data. These results underscore the critical need for ongoing research and the development of more effective therapies, especially given the low long-term survival rates in pancreatic cancer. Every step we take brings us closer to making a meaningful impact in the fight against this challenging disease.” Nicolas Poirier, CEO of OSE Immunotherapeutics: “The initial results provide a glimmer of hope in the fight against advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer. This disease is notoriously difficult to treat, and the need for effective therapies is urgent. These early results show potential promising benefit in some subsets of patients; further research and analysis are needed to confirm their impact. These additional positive results in a randomized clinical trial represent another step forward for the development of Tedopi® and more broadly, these data provide more evidence for the therapeutic cancer vaccine modality.” ABOUT PANCREATIC DUCTAL ADENOCARCINOMA (PDAC) PDAC is a highly aggressive form of cancer originating in the ducts of the pancreas. It represents about 95% of all pancreatic cancers. The global burden of pancreatic cancer has more than doubled in recent decades. It is now the sixth leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, with an estimated 510,922 new cases and 467,409 deaths in 2022. The incidence of the disease continues to rise annually, with projections indicating a 95.4% increase in new cases by 2050. The overall five-year survival rate for pancreatic cancer is 10% worldwide, showing only a modest improvement over the past decade3. More than 67,000 Americans will be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2025, which is the equivalent of 184 people being diagnosed every day. Pancreatic cancer is now the 10th most found cancer in the US4 and represents about 3.5% of all new cancer diagnoses, and 7.1% of all cancer deaths in the EU5. Surgical resection is the only potential curative treatment for PDAC, but it’s feasible for only 15-20% of patients at diagnosis due to the advanced stage of the disease6. Even with successful surgery and neoadjuvant therapies, the prognosis remains poor, with a high likelihood of recurrence, underscoring the need for continued research and development of more effective systemic therapies to improve outcomes for patients with pancreatic cancer7. ABOUT GERCOR GERCOR is a multidisciplinary association dedicated to clinical research in oncology whose purpose is to improve the care of patients affected by cancer by developing clinical research in the scope of an independent, multidisciplinary and multi-focused cooperative group. GERCOR concentrates its efforts on only one mission: clinical research. Thanks to its network, GERCOR offers patients easy access to its up-to-date treatments. To achieve this goal, GERCOR has all the logistical structure needed to carry out the trials it promotes.ABOUT OSE IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS OSE Immunotherapeutics is a biotech company dedicated to developing first-in-class assets in immuno-oncology (IO) and immuno-inflammation (I&I) that address the unmet patient needs of today and tomorrow.

"Ipsen appoints Olivia Brown as Executive Vice-President, Global Head of Neurotoxins","March 12, 2025 02:28 ET","PARIS, FRANCE, March 12th, 2025 - Ipsen (Euronext: IPN; ADR: IPSEY), a global specialty care-driven company, announced today the appointment of Olivia Brown as, EVP, Global Head of Neurotoxins, effective April 1st, 2025.  She will serve on Ipsen’s Executive Leadership Team (ELT) and report directly to Chief Executive Officer David Loew. In this newly created role, she will lead Ipsen’s global neurotoxins franchise, overseeing strategy and execution across both therapeutic and aesthetic indications. Over the last 30 years in the neurotoxins market, Ipsen has established itself as one of the leading players in neurosciences, successfully driving research, clinical development and growth based on significant manufacturing know-how and capacity. ""We are delighted to welcome Olivia to Ipsen’s Executive Leadership Team. With her deep expertise in neurotoxins, combined with her experience in global strategy and commercialization, she will be instrumental in further accelerating our growth and innovation in neurotoxins, both in the therapeutic and aesthetic space,"" said David Loew, CEO, Ipsen. “With a robust portfolio of products and an attractive pipeline including the potential break-through innovation of the recombinant Long-Acting Neuro-Toxine (LANT) program, it is the right time for us to create an integrated franchise. The long acting neurotoxin was uniquely designed to bind to the receptors used by the BoNT B and to deliver the active light chain of the BoNT A, demonstrating in preclinical studies a longer duration of action and less tissue spread compared to currently available BoNT As. We believe LANT AB has the potential ability to deliver better outcomes for patients with an increased duration of action, leading to a potential reduction in injection frequency and enhanced tolerability.” Olivia brings over 20 years of global leadership experience in pharmaceuticals and medical aesthetics, with a strong track record in business transformation, market expansion, and product launches. Most recently, she was at Novartis, where she led the establishment of a new therapeutic area in Allergy & Immunology. Previously, she held senior leadership positions at Merz Aesthetics and Galderma, where she played a key role in expanding the global neurotoxins market.""I am excited to join Ipsen at such an important time for its neurotoxins business. Ipsen has a strong foundation in innovation, and I look forward to working with the team to build on this success and drive further growth in this dynamic market,” said Olivia Brown. This appointment reflects Ipsen’s continued investment in neurotoxin innovation, global expansion, and leadership in both therapeutic and aesthetic indications. * botulinum toxin type B (BoNT-B) ** botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A) About Ipsen  We are a global biopharmaceutical company with a focus on bringing transformative medicines to patients in three therapeutic areas: Oncology, Rare Disease and Neuroscience.

Ipsen contacts Investors Media Disclaimers and/or Forward-Looking StatementsThe forward-looking statements, objectives and targets contained herein are based on Ipsen’s management strategy, current views and assumptions. Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets, which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’, ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events, including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover, the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions, which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future, and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties, notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets, notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore, the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore, Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials, or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to, general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors, including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances, new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development, including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation, including patent litigation, and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business, financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward looking statements, targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events, conditions, assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based, unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen’s business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers. The risks and uncertainties set out are not exhaustive and the reader is advised to refer to Ipsen’s latest Universal Registration Document, available on ipsen.com.

(Nasdaq: SGMT), clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics targeting dysfunctional metabolic and fibrotic pathways, today reported financial results for the full year ended December 31, 2024, and provided recent corporate updates. “2024 was a highly productive year for Sagimet, and we’re carrying that momentum into a strong start for 2025,” said David Happel, Chief Executive Officer of Sagimet. “We are pleased to have initiated our Phase 3 denifanstat program in MASH, with site activation and patient pre-screening underway and patient screening expected to begin soon. With the successful Phase 2b FASCINATE-2 results we reported in 2024, and Breakthrough Therapy designation granted by the FDA, we are confident in denifanstat’s potential to address the significant unmet need for patients living with MASH. At the same time, we are excited to advance a second Fatty Acid Synthase inhibitor, TVB-3567, into the clinic for the potential treatment of moderate to severe acne, following IND clearance. Given the potential of FASN inhibition across multiple disease states, we look forward to progressing both denifanstat and TVB-3567 in the coming year.” Full Year and Recent Corporate Highlights Clinical and Regulatory Updates Publications and Presentations Corporate Updates Anticipated Upcoming Milestones Financial Results for the Full Year Ended December 31, 2024 About Sagimet Biosciences Sagimet is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel fatty acid synthase (FASN) inhibitors that are designed to target dysfunctional metabolic and fibrotic pathways in diseases resulting from the overproduction of the fatty acid, palmitate. Sagimet’s lead drug candidate, denifanstat, is an oral, once-daily pill and selective FASN inhibitor in development for the treatment of metabolic dysfunction associated steatohepatitis (MASH). FASCINATE-2, a Phase 2b clinical trial of denifanstat in MASH with liver biopsy-based primary endpoints, was successfully completed with positive results. Denifanstat has been granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA for the treatment of non-cirrhotic MASH with moderate to advanced liver fibrosis (consistent with stages F2 to F3 fibrosis), and end-of-Phase 2 interactions with the FDA have been successfully completed, supporting the advancement of denifanstat into Phase 3 development in MASH. For additional information about Sagimet, please visit www.sagimet.com. About MASH Metabolic-dysfunction associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is a progressive and severe liver disease which is estimated to impact more than 115 million people worldwide, for which there is only one recently approved treatment in the United States and no currently approved treatments in Europe. In 2023, global liver disease medical societies and patient groups formalized the decision to rename non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) to MASH. Additionally, an overarching term, steatotic liver disease (SLD), was established to capture multiple types of liver diseases associated with fat buildup in the liver. The goal of the name change was to establish an affirmative, non-stigmatizing name and diagnosis.

A number of factors caused the company to reconsider its strategy to adequately protect its shareholders. Nymox CEO Paul Averback said, ""The dismissal at this stage is a legal step after consultation with counsel, with whom we have full confidence. We assure our shareholders that further steps are contemplated and we will report accordingly at the appropriate time."" About NYMOX Nymox has submitted applications seeking the approval to, and continues to consider submitting additional applications seeking the approval to market the Company's first in class drug NYMOZARFEX (TM) to treat the symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). BPH is one of the most common conditions affecting middle aged and elderly men throughout the world. BPH can be devastating to men who suffer from the condition. Current treatments are associated with numerous intolerable side effects including sexual problems, such as impotence and retrograde ejaculation. Medications for BPH have been associated with prostate cancer, depression, gynecomastia and other adverse effects. The majority of men stop taking the available medications due to these and other problems. Surgery is often needed for advanced BPH. Surgery is usually effective but it is not without risks, the discomforts of surgery, and BPH surgery has side effects such as permanent retrograde ejaculation for many patients. Nymox has reported 10-year follow-up new data on all available patients from its U.S. clinical trial of NYMOZARFEX (TM) for the treatment of low grade localized prostate cancer. The available long-term data newly assessed, confirmed that all available data shows that the NYMOZARFEX (TM) treatment had important and statistically significant benefit for reducing the long-term progression of these prostate cancers. About NYMOZARFEX (TM) (Fexapotide) NYMOZARFEX (TM) is given in an in-office procedure that is administered in a few minutes without need of anesthesia or analgesia. The drug has been tested in clinical trials involving overall more than 1750 patients with over 1600 injections administered including over 1200 NYMOZARFEX (TM) administrations. NYMOZARFEX (TM) has led to significant long-term improvements and has shown an excellent safety profile without the side effects normally associated with existing BPH treatments.

With more than 30% of GPs in Germany over the age of 55 and a projected shortfall of tens of thousands of GPs in the coming years, these figures are in line with broader trends across Europe, where a shortage of healthcare professionals is expected to reach approximately 4 million by 2030.

By investing in Vantis, Angelini Ventures is advancing its mission to support solutions that can improve healthcare outcomes and efficiency. Vantis’ integrated healthcare model aligns with Angelini Ventures' belief that technology-enabled solutions are essential to addressing the growing pressure on healthcare systems across Europe.

Its approach not only streamlines practice operations but also enables physicians to deliver more personalized and data-driven care, particularly for patients with chronic conditions. This model has the potential to address similar healthcare challenges across Europe, aligning with our commitment to supporting companies that bring tangible, technology-enabled improvements to healthcare.” Till Jansen, Co-founder and CEO of Vantis, emphasizes: “Significant investments are essential for the digital transformation of the healthcare system so that in the end, everyone benefits: doctors, patients, and payers. As a software company with our own practices, we have the unique ability to tailor our technology to the current challenges in primary care and continuously optimize it. Our goal is to achieve better treatment outcomes for patients while simplifying doctors’ daily routines—so they can focus more on what truly matters: providing medical care.” *** Notes to EditorsAbout Angelini Ventures Angelini Ventures, the venture capital arm of Angelini Industries, is a Series A and Series B investment firm focused on accelerating disruptive innovations and trends in BioTech and Digital Health.

"Tecan reports 2024 financial results, enhancing operational resilience amid challenging conditions","March 12, 2025 01:00 ET","Ad hoc announcement pursuant to Article 53 of the SIX Exchange Regulation Listing Rules Tecan reports 2024 financial results, enhancing operational resilience amid challenging conditions Financial results for the full year 2024 – Highlights Highlights 2024 Männedorf, Switzerland, March 12, 2025 – The Tecan Group (SIX Swiss Exchange: TECN) today announced its full set of audited financial results for 2024, underscoring its commitment to enhancing operational resilience amid challenging conditions. The company also initiated its short-term financial outlook for 2025. Tecan CEO Dr. Achim von Leoprechting commented: «Tecan is navigating a challenging market environment marked by reduced spending in our target markets, leading to lower demand in both the Life Sciences and Partnering Business segments. These challenges have been compounded by general market weakness in China and specific customer-related factors. In response, we have implemented a comprehensive cost reduction program and optimized our global operations to reinforce our leading position. The long-term trends in healthcare remain unchanged: from life science research to clinical applications, automation and innovation are crucial for scaling healthcare solutions in research, clinical diagnostics, and medtech. This is especially important amid rising healthcare costs, ultimately benefiting people worldwide. With our dedicated team, we are driving exciting innovations and look forward to launching promising new products across both businesses, positioning us well to capitalize on market recovery as conditions improve.» Financial results full-year and second half of 2024 Full-year order entry was CHF 903.6 million, a decrease of 12.1% compared to CHF 1,028.1 million in 2023, reflecting a 10.5% decline in local currencies. The Partnering Business segment was impacted by a shift in OEM customer ordering patterns, moving from larger, long-term orders in 2023 to smaller, more regular orders in 2024 as supply chain disruptions had fully normalized. Meanwhile, the Life Sciences Business segment saw moderate order entry growth in local currencies in the second half of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Overall, the Group's order entry in the second half decreased by 11.2% in local currencies. In 2024, reduced spending in the biopharmaceutical industry led to decreased demand for life science research instruments, affecting both the Life Sciences Business and the Partnering Business. Additionally, a general market weakness in China impacted both direct sales and indirect business through global OEM customers. In the Partnering Business, sales were further influenced by specific customer-related factors, including normalized demand patterns following inventory replenishment by a key customer in 2023. As a result, reported sales for the Group in fiscal year 2024 decreased by 13.0% in Swiss francs, totaling CHF 934.3 million (2023: CHF 1,074.4 million). In local currencies, sales were 11.5% below the prior-year period, aligning with the revised sales outlook from October 2024, which anticipated a decline of 12-14%. Sales in the second half decreased by 12.3% in Swiss francs and by 11.3% in local currencies compared to the prior-year period. These sales results were previously communicated in a trading statement on January 8, 2025. Adjusted EBITDA1 (operating profit before depreciation and amortization) was CHF 164.4 million, down from CHF 220.6 million in 2023. The adjusted EBITDA margin decreased to 17.6% of sales (2023: 20.5%), aligning with the revised margin outlook of 16-18%. The decline was primarily due to lower sales volumes, as profitability is highly volume-dependent. However, profitability was supported by a comprehensive cost-reduction program. Additionally, exchange rate movements in major currencies against the Swiss franc negatively impacted the margin by approximately 40 basis points. Adjusted net profit2 was CHF 103.1 million, down from CHF 164.4 million in 2023, when earnings were significantly boosted by a one-time positive effect related to transitional measures from the Swiss tax reform. Adjusted earnings per share were CHF 8.08, compared to CHF 12.88 in 2023. Cash flow from operating activities was CHF 148.5 million, compared to CHF 160.6 million in 2023. Cash conversion improved to 100.0% of reported EBITDA (2023: 77.5%). Thanks to solid cash flow management, Tecan's net liquidity position (cash and cash equivalents plus short-term time deposits, less bank liabilities, loans, and the outstanding bond) increased to CHF 153.7 million as of December 31, 2024, up from CHF 112.6 million on December 31, 2023. Information by business segment Life Sciences Business (end-customer business)Sales in the Life Sciences Business in 2024 reached CHF 397.0 million (2023: CHF 451.8 million or CHF 442.1 million in local currencies), reflecting a decrease of 12.1% in Swiss francs and 10.2% in local currencies. Reduced CAPEX spending by the biopharmaceutical industry globally, along with government and academic customers in the US, resulted in decreased demand for life science research instruments. Additionally, market weakness in China negatively impacted demand, as the announced stimulus program failed to provide any impetus in 2024. Instead, it prompted some customers to delay orders while awaiting funding decisions. Contributing to a more favorable sales development in the Life Sciences Business were recovering consumables sales post-pandemic, a solid service business due to a higher installed base of instruments, and continued strong demand for newly launched products, particularly from genomic diagnostics companies. Recurring sales of services, consumables and reagents increased to 57.6% of segment sales (2023: 52.8%).In the second half of the year, sales declined by 5.0% in local currencies, following the sharp 15.5% decline in the first half. Sequentially, the Life Sciences Business segment grew by 13.6% in local currencies when comparing the second half of 2024 to the first half.In the second half of 2024, the Life Sciences Business segment experienced moderate order entry growth in local currencies compared to the same period in 2023, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio slightly above 1 for the full year. Reported EBIT in this segment (earnings before interest and taxes) reached CHF 39.5 million (2023: CHF 84.4 million). The reported operating profit margin decreased to 9.8% of sales (2023: 18.3%), primarily due to the negative volume effect, which resulted in missing economies of scale. Cost control measures helped alleviate the impact of lower sales volumes and adverse exchange rate effects. The adjusted EBITDA3 (operating profit before depreciation and amortization) for this segment was CHF 79.1 million, compared to CHF 105.5 million in 2023. This reflects an adjusted EBITDA margin of 19.6% of sales, compared to 22.9% in 2023. Partnering Business (OEM business)The Partnering Business generated sales of CHF 537.3 million in 2024 (2023: CHF 622.6 million or CHF 613.1 million in local currencies), marking a decrease of 13.7% in Swiss francs and 12.4% in local currencies. As anticipated, Tecan did not record any meaningful sales from the pass-through of material costs in this segment for 2024, compared to CHF 8.0 million in 2023. The lower demand for life science instrumentation also had a negative impact on the Partnering Business, influencing both the Cavro® OEM components business and the contract development and manufacturing revenues for life science instruments in the Paramit product line. Market weakness in China also impacted the Cavro OEM components business and sales of in-vitro diagnostics systems in the Synergence™ product line to larger global OEM customers with significant exposure to China. However, outside China, sales of in-vitro diagnostics systems in the Synergence product line developed positively, with increased contributions from newly launched systems. Sales in the Paramit product line, which served medical market customers, were negatively affected by normalized demand patterns following the replenishment of depleted inventories in 2023, when supply chain disruptions eased, and by the anticipated reduction in sales from the pure pass-through of material costs. These impacts were specific to a single customer and included a model transition, rather than being related to end market conditions. All these factors had a more pronounced impact in the second half of the year, when segment sales decreased by 15.9% in local currencies.Order entry in the Partnering Business for the full year decreased slightly more than sales as OEM customers adjusted their ordering patterns, shifting from larger, long-term orders in 2023 to smaller, more regular orders in 2024 as supply chain disruptions had fully normalized. Despite this shift, the book-to-bill ratio remained close to 1. Reported EBIT amounted to CHF 46.6 million (2023: CHF 64.4 million), while the reported operating profit margin reached 8.7% of sales (2023: 10.3%). Similar to the Life Sciences Business segment, lower sales volumes and the resulting negative economies of scale were the main factors affecting margin development. The adjusted EBITDA3 for this segment was CHF 91.1 million, compared to CHF 125.6 million in 2023. This reflects an adjusted EBITDA margin of 16.9% of sales, compared to 20.1% in 2023. Highlights 2024 Enhancing operational resilience through cost-reduction initiatives, while expanding global operations and commercial reachIn 2024, Tecan enhanced its operational resilience by implementing a comprehensive cost-reduction program and continuing to optimize its global organizational footprint. Following the successful transfer of Cavro component production to facilities in Morgan Hill, California, and Penang, Malaysia, and the closure of the San Jose site in 2023, Tecan relocated its genomic reagents site from Redwood City to the expanding Morgan Hill hub at the end of 2024. In Penang, Tecan successfully passed an extensive FDA inspection, laying a strong foundation for future production of medical devices, including class 3 devices. The first medical device production was successfully transitioned to Penang in 2024. Alongside site consolidation, Tecan focused on supply chain optimization and increased vertical integration of manufacturing to leverage the Group's full capabilities and realize cost synergies.On the commercial front, Tecan established a direct sales office in South Korea in 2024 by acquiring a long-standing distributor in the region. This new entity includes team members with over 20 years of experience working with Tecan, bringing valuable local market knowledge to better serve this growing market. Innovation and product launches in the Life Sciences Business In 2024, Tecan advanced its product portfolio with significant launches in genomics, proteomics, and cell biology. Examples include the Resolvex i300 module, introduced in February, which enhances throughput in proteomics by integrating with the Fluent® platform, and the Spark Cyto 3D, which supports drug discovery by enabling the analysis of complex 3D cell models. During a Capital Markets Day in October 2024, Tecan previewed Veya™, a multi-omics liquid handling workstation that simplifies lab automation and boosts productivity. Officially launched at the Society for Laboratory Automation and Screening (SLAS) international conference in San Diego, USA, in January 2025, Veya provides effortless automation by overcoming key barriers in lab automation. Tecan also expanded its digital ecosystem with the new Introspect analytics platform, enhancing operational insights and service efficiency. This digital expansion benefits customers across both business segments. New launches and rich project pipeline in Partnering Business At the 2024 Capital Markets Day, Tecan highlighted its strong Partnering Business relationships and robust project pipeline across its three business lines: Synergence, Cavro, and Paramit. Examples include Tecan's collaboration with Illumina in the Synergence line, supporting their expansion into multi-omics with the development of a new system. Through Paramit, Tecan assisted THINK® Surgical with the design transfer and initiated the manufacturing of their TMINI® miniature robotic system, cart, and smart cell charging station. Additionally, Paramit is manufacturing the Avive Connect AED, an innovative and user-friendly automated external defibrillator aimed at improving survival rates for sudden cardiac arrest. The pipeline of new development projects has been further enriched through joint selling of Synergence, Cavro, and Paramit services, targeting key customers in the life sciences, lab diagnostics, and Medtech segments. Tecan aims to double new project signings by 2027 through joint selling efforts, a targeted approach, and strategic account management. Further building on sustainability activitiesTecan's 2024 Sustainability Report, published as part of the Annual Report, includes a Climate Risk Scenarios Analysis, highlighting the company's proactive approach to addressing transition and physical risks related to climate change. In preparation for the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), Tecan has integrated related data management into its Finance function. For the first time, Tecan's financial auditors conducted a limited assurance audit of key 2024 environmental and social data points. Further progress was made towards greenhouse gas emissions reduction commitments, with renewable sources accounting for 87% of all electricity purchased. In 2025, Tecan will continue its pragmatic approach to managing risks and opportunities associated with the company's material topics. Proposal for a stable dividend at the Annual General Meeting Based on the solid cash flows for the full year 2024 and on the basis of an ongoing positive business outlook, the Board of Directors will propose at the Company’s Annual General Meeting on April 18, 2024, an unchanged dividend of CHF 3.00 per share. Half of the dividend, i.e., CHF 1.50, will again be paid out from the available capital contribution reserve and is therefore not subject to withholding tax. Outlook The overall market environment is showing first signs of stabilization after a significant decline in demand last year, with further improvements expected over the course of 2025. However, new political uncertainties have emerged, including the announced reductions to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) research budget in the US, which could further impact demand for life science research instruments. For 2025, Tecan anticipates that the year will begin with continued softer market conditions, with potential improvement as the year progresses. Depending on the extent of this improvement in the second half, the market could turn slightly positive for the full year, driven by specific growth segments, such as the clinical diagnostics market. Acknowledging the current market conditions, Tecan has initiated its short-term financial outlook for 2025, with a full-year guidance range from a low single-digit decline to low single-digit growth in sales in local currencies. The company expects sales in local currencies to decline in the first half, with a softer first quarter and a sequential improvement in the second quarter. A more positive outlook for the second half is supported by a strong reception of newly launched products and partnerships in both divisions, along with additional launches in 2025. In 2024, Tecan demonstrated its commitment to agile cost management amid evolving economic conditions and revenue trends by implementing a comprehensive cost-reduction program and optimizing its global organizational footprint. These efforts are designed to protect profitability without limiting the company's growth potential. As a result, Tecan forecasts an adjusted EBITDA margin, excluding restructuring, acquisition- and integration-related costs, of 17.5-18.5% of sales. The outlook 2025 does not take account of potential acquisitions during the course of the year. The expectations regarding profitability are based on an average exchange rate forecast for full year 2025 of one euro equaling CHF 0.95 and one US dollar equaling CHF 0.90. Tecan also reiterated its mid-term outlook, in which the company anticipates returning to average organic growth rates in the mid to high single-digit percentage range in local currencies under normal market conditions, while continuously improving profitability.

Theratechnologies Presents Encouraging Virologic Suppression Data from the PROMISE-US Trial of Ibalizumab at CROI,"March 12, 2025 07:30 ET","Results show similar levels of virus undetectability in patients on ibalizumab-containing regimens as in controls, despite greater baseline severity of HIV Ibalizumab continues to demonstrate long-term efficacy and safety as part of combination antiretroviral therapy in heavily treatment-experienced people with multidrug resistant HIV MONTREAL, March  12, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Theratechnologies Inc. (“Theratechnologies” or the “Company”) (TSX: TH) (NASDAQ: THTX), a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company, today presented data from a real-world, observational, registry study demonstrating the efficacy and safety of ibalizumab in reducing HIV RNA to undetectable levels in heavily treatment-experienced (HTE) patients with multidrug resistant HIV. In a poster session at the 2025 Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI) in San Francisco, Calif., investigators from the Prospective Observational Study of Multidrug-Resistant Patient Outcomes with and without Ibalizumab in a Real-World Setting: United States (PROMISE-US) reported that patients treated with regimens containing ibalizumab achieved undetectable HIV viral load levels at similar rates as those receiving non-ibalizumab-containing regimens, despite displaying characteristics indicative of more severe HIV disease at baseline. “The availability of long-term injectable therapies has not eliminated the phenomenon of multidrug resistance, and heavily treatment-experienced people with HIV deserve fully suppressive antiretroviral regimens that can help them establish and maintain virologic control,” stated presenting author Smitha Gudipati, MD, an infectious disease specialist at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, Mich. “We are therefore encouraged to see such impressive reductions in viremia in patients whose regimens include ibalizumab, despite having lower CD4 counts and higher viral loads at baseline than the non-ibalizumab control group.” Theratechnologies previously announced the study design and baseline characteristics of participants in PROMISE-US (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT05388474), a phase 4, multicenter, retrospective and prospective, observational, non-interventional registry study. The trial is designed to assess risk factors and predictors of virologic and immunologic response in HTE people with HIV (PWH) and specific sub-populations. Its primary objective is to evaluate the long-term efficacy and durability of ibalizumab, a CD4-directed post-attachment inhibitor of HIV, in combination with other antiretroviral therapies by comparing the clinical outcomes of patients receiving ibalizumab (Cohort 2) versus matched patients not receiving ibalizumab (Cohort 1). At CROI, the PROMISE-US investigators presented an interim, unmatched subgroup analysis comprising 112 participants, of whom 70 were enrolled in Cohort 1 and 42 in Cohort 2. At baseline, 27 of participants in Cohort 1 and 25 in Cohort 2 were viremic, defined as viral load above 50 RNA copies/mL (39% and 57%, respectively; p=0.0279). Three-quarters (74%) of participants in Cohort 1 who had baseline viremia had more than 200 CD4 T-cells/mm3 at baseline, compared to only 44% of those in Cohort 2 who were viremic at baseline (p=0.0376). Among those with baseline viremia, 50% of Cohort 1 participants and 47% in Cohort 2 achieved undetectable viral load (≤50 RNA copies/mL) after six months of treatment (p=0.873). At 12 months, viral load was undetectable in 53% of Cohort 1 participants and in 42% of those in Cohort 2 (p=0.0.524). Ibalizumab was well-tolerated with no infusion reactions reported and no discontinuation of treatment by participants in Cohort 2 due to a treatment emergent adverse event. “The PROMISE-US trial is the first registry to capture long-term clinical outcomes for highly treatment-experienced patients with multidrug-resistant HIV in a real-world setting and in the US specifically,” commented Christian Marsolais, Ph.D., Senior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer of Theratechnologies. “The data presented today suggest that ibalizumab can be a critical component of therapeutic regimens in the modern antiretroviral era. We look forward to validating these interim findings as we continue to enroll and monitor patients in this ongoing study.” About Theratechnologies Theratechnologies (TSX: TH) (NASDAQ: THTX) is a specialty biopharmaceutical company focused on the commercialization of innovative therapies that have the potential to redefine standards of care.

InspireMD Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Financial Results,"March 12, 2025 07:00 ET","MIAMI, March  12, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- InspireMD, Inc. (Nasdaq: NSPR), developer of the CGuard™ Prime carotid stent system for the treatment of carotid artery disease and prevention of stroke, today announced financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2024. Recent Business Highlights: Marvin Slosman, CEO of InspireMD, commented: “2024 was a year of tremendous progress at InspireMD. We advanced CGuard Prime, our best-in-class carotid implant, toward potential U.S. approval by submitting our PMA application to the FDA. We also initiated the CGUARDIANS II pivotal study for its use in the large and growing TCAR market — an important step in expanding our development pipeline.” “We continue to see a clear path toward a potential CGuard Prime launch in the first half of 2025, pending approval. We are working closely with the FDA to support the review process and look forward to bringing this innovative technology to patients in the U.S. I look forward to key clinical, regulatory, and commercial milestones in the months ahead, particularly the potential U.S. approval and commercial launch of CGuard Prime,” Mr. Slosman concluded. Financial Results for the Fourth Quarter Ended December 31, 2024For the fourth quarter of 2024, total revenue increased by $188,000, or 10.7%, to $1,949,000, from $1,761,000 during the fourth quarter of 2023. This increase was predominantly driven by growth in new and existing markets. Gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2024 decreased by $36,000, or 7.1%, to $469,000, compared to a gross profit of $505,000 for the fourth quarter of 2023. This decrease in gross profit resulted from an increase in cost of goods sold. This increase was primarily due to an increase in material and labor costs, driven mainly to higher sales volume, and increased compensation expense for new and current employees. The increase of cost of goods sold was offset by an increase of the revenues as described above. Total operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2024 were $9,836,000, an increase of $3,523,000, or 55.8% compared to $6,313,000 for the fourth quarter of 2023. This increase was primarily due to increases in expenses related to salaries and share-based compensation as we continue to expand our US personnel and sales force in anticipation of FDA approval. In addition, there was an increase of expenses due to clinical, regulatory and development expenses related to our expected launch into the TCAR (transcarotid revascularization) market and CGuard Prime product preparation expenses for the anticipated U.S. commercial launch, offset by a reduction in clinical trial expenses associated with the C-GUARDIANS FDA Study as the one-year follow-up finalized in the second quarter of 2024. Financial income, net for the fourth quarter of 2024 was $252,000, a decrease of $216,000 or 46.1% compared to $468,000 for the fourth quarter of 2023. This decrease was primarily due to less interest income from investments in marketable securities and money market funds. Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2024 totaled $9,174,000 or $0.19 per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of $5,405,000, or $0.16 per basic and diluted share, for the same period in 2023. As of December 31, 2024, cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were $34,637,000 compared to $39,023,000 as of December 31, 2023. Financial Results for the Full Year Ended December 31, 2024 For the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, revenue increased by $804,000, or 13.0%, to $7,009,000, from $6,205,000 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. This increase was driven by growth in existing and new markets. Gross profit for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, decreased by 16.7%, or $301,000, to $1,506,000, compared to a gross profit of $1,807,000 for the same period in 2023. This decrease in gross profit resulted from an increase in cost of goods sold. This increase was primarily due to an increase in material and labor costs, driven mainly to higher sales volume, and increased compensation expense for new and current employees. In addition, there was an increase of other cost of goods sold related to miscellaneous expenses. The increase of cost of goods sold was offset by an increase of the revenues as described above. Gross margin (gross profits as a percentage of revenue) decreased to 21.5% during the year ended December 31, 2024, from 29.1% during the year ended December 31, 2023, driven by the factors mentioned above. Total operating expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, were $35,009,000, an increase of $12,059,000, or 52.5% compared to $22,950,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily due to increases in expenses related to salaries and share-based compensation as we expand our US personnel and sales force in anticipation of FDA approval. In addition, an increase of expenses for clinical, regulatory and development expenses related to our expected launch into the TCAR (transcarotid revascularization) market, CGuard Prime product preparation expenses for the anticipated U.S. commercial launch, offset by a reduction in clinical trial expenses associated with the C-GUARDIANS FDA Study as the one-year follow-up finalized in the second quarter of 2024. Financial income, net for the twelve months ended December 2024, was $1,557,000, an increase of $265,000 or 20.5% compared to $1,292,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. The increase in financial income primarily resulted from an increase in interest income from investments in marketable securities and money market funds. Net loss for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, totaled $32,005,000, or $0.76 per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of $19,916,000, or $0.82 per basic and diluted share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023.

Bioxytran Develops a Groundbreaking Treatment to Combat Bird Flu in Egg Laying Chickens Potentially Saving Billions,"March 12, 2025 09:30 ET","New water-soluble galectin antagonist being considered in preclinical trials offering hope for rapid containment to H5N1 outbreaks BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS, March  12, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BIOXYTRAN, INC. (OTCQB: BIXT) (the “Company”), a clinical stage biotechnology company developing oral and intravenous drugs to treat viral diseases, unveiled a potential game-changer in the fight against Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), commonly known as Bird Flu. This innovative water-soluble galectin antagonist, currently in preclinical trials, could revolutionize how outbreaks are managed in egg-laying chickens, preventing mass culling and safeguarding the global food supply. Bioxytran’s treatment leverages galectin antagonists, a class of molecules designed to block viral entry into cells, by neutralizing the virus in egg-laying chickens. This approach could prevent the spread of H5N1 without the need for mass culling, a current requirement during outbreaks. Galectin antagonists have shown their ability to block viral adhesion. This has been proven in Phase 2 human clinical trials and in vitro tests. The Company thinks this mechanism works the same in all mammals. This is the reason why the Company expects it to be very effective in chickens. While the Company is also working on establishing the optimal delivery method, it is actively seeking partnerships with organizations and government agencies to accelerate the development and deployment of this groundbreaking treatment. “This breakthrough represents a significant step forward in our mission to combat viral diseases,” said David Platt, CEO of Bioxytran Inc. ""By targeting the virus directly, we can protect both animal health and the global food supply. Our galectin antagonists block the spike proteins outside the cell. This may stop the spread of the disease right away. Our peer-reviewed study showed that our carbohydrate-based galectin antagonists attach to viral spike proteins. This stops the proteins from connecting to cells. This mechanism is found in all mammals and forms the basis of our research, which should eliminate the risk of possible mutations. Bird Flu outbreaks have devastating economic consequences, costing the poultry industry billions annually. Current protocols require the culling of entire flocks, leading to significant losses for farmers and disruptions in the food supply chain. Our treatment could eliminate the need for such drastic measures, offering a more sustainable solution. We are actively seeking partnerships.” About H5N1 According to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) there were 369 million egg producing chickens at the start of 2025 of which 304 million produce the United States domestic supply of table eggs.1 Last quarter more than 20 million egg-laying chickens were culled due to bird flu.2 Last year the Animal and Plant Health inspection Service said it spent $1.25 billion on payment to farmers since the bird flu outbreak started in 2022.3 The Trump administration is rolling out a new strategy stressing vaccination and tighter biosecurity. This has led to a significant increase in egg prices, with some regions experiencing price hikes of up to 250% since 2019. The continued spread of bird flu could further exacerbate these issues, leading to even higher prices and supply shortages, ultimately affecting consumers and the overall economy.

Corvus Pharmaceuticals Announces Initiation of Phase 2 Clinical Trial of Soquelitinib for Patients with Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome (ALPS),"March 12, 2025 08:00 ET","Trial for this rare genetic disease to be conducted by NIH/NIAID in partnership with Corvus ITK inhibition intended to address dysregulation of T cells that causes ALPS and has been shown to be effective at treating the disease in preclinical models BURLINGAME, Calif., March  12, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Corvus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: CRVS), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, today announced that the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), has initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial of soquelitinib for the treatment of patients with autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS), a rare genetic disease. The lead investigator of the trial is V. Koneti Rao, MD, FRCPA, Senior Research Physician, Primary Immune Deficiency Clinic (ALPS Clinic) at NIH Clinical Center. Dr. Rao previously presented preclinical data supporting the potential of soquelitinib in patients with ALPS. Other trial sites include Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and Texas Children’s Cancer and Hematology Center. “Developing safe and effective targeted treatments to address ALPS and related disorders is a priority at the NIAID since this condition was first discovered in NIAID in the early 1990s,” said Dr. Rao. “ALPS typically begins to manifest by age two and most patients live into adulthood with burdensome symptoms often related to refractory autoimmune cytopenias (low blood counts). This requires ongoing surveillance and the risk for potentially fatal conditions such as infection, hemorrhage and malignant lymphoma. We look forward to investigating the potential of ITK inhibition with soquelitinib to improve immune system balance and reduce the buildup of dysfunctional T cells in lymph nodes and spleens and autoantibodies that drive the disease.” ALPS is most often caused by a mutation in the gene for the Fas protein, which spans the cell membrane and helps facilitate apoptosis, or programmed cell death. When this protein is missing or defective, T cells can build up and disrupt the immune system, leading to potentially debilitating symptoms and an increased risk for developing serious health conditions, including autoimmune diseases and lymphoma. There currently is no cure for ALPS and the disorder is managed by a variety of empirical methods aimed at addressing pathological changes caused by the disease, such low blood-cell counts (cytopenias), excessive lymphocyte production (lymphoproliferation), enlarged spleen or lymph nodes, and lymphoma. Treatments may include corticosteroids such as prednisone and other immunosuppressive medications to modulate the immune system, or cancer therapies to address lymphoma. “We are excited to expand the potential of ITK inhibition to address people with ALPS, which is a serious genetic disease that begins in childhood and gets worse due to progression during young adulthood and lacks good treatment options,” said Richard A. Miller, M.D., co-founder, president and chief executive officer of Corvus. “There is compelling preclinical evidence that soquelitinib may address the immune dysregulation in T cells that is a hallmark of the disease. It also bridges the biology of T cell lymphomas and autoimmunity, highlighting the role that ITK inhibition may play in restoring immune balance in lymphoma and immune disease. This adds to our conviction for the potential of soquelitinib as we continue to enroll patients in our registrational Phase 3 trial in PTCL and Phase 1 trial in atopic dermatitis.” The Phase 2 clinical trial (NCT06730126) is designed to enroll up to 30 patients aged 16 or older with confirmed ALPS-FAS based on genetic testing. Two dosing cohorts will be studied. The patients will receive soquelitinib doses of 200 mg or 400 mg twice per day for a period of up to 360 days. The primary endpoint of the trial is efficacy determined by reductions in splenomegaly and lymph node volumes as measured by computed tomography (CT) or positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). Improvements in cytopenias will be assessed by complete blood count (CBC). Cytopenias are caused by autoantibodies as well as splenic sequestration that may lead to destruction of red blood cells, platelets and/or neutrophils leading to anemia, thrombocytopenia or neutropenia. Improvements in cytopenias can improve quality of life and overall health, and they also serve as a valuable biomarker associated with ALPS disease activity. Secondary endpoints include safety and tolerability. This is the third indication under clinical development for soquelitinib, which is also in a registrational Phase 3 trial for peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL) and a Phase 1 trial for atopic dermatitis (AD). Corvus also plans to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial of soquelitinib in patients with solid tumors in the second quarter 2025. About Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome (ALPS)ALPS is a rare genetic disease inherited as a germline autosomal dominant pattern or due to somatic mosaicism affecting children that manifests with lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, cytopenias (low blood counts) and autoimmunity. The disease is caused by a mutation in the Fas gene, which provides instructions for making a signaling protein involved in the induction of apoptosis to get rid of redundant lymphocytes. The mutation results in immune dysregulation due to accumulation abnormally high levels of “double negative” T cells (CD4 and CD8 double negative), which infiltrate the blood, spleen and lymphoid tissues. Fas signaling is regulated by ITK and T cell receptor signaling and patients with ALPS have an imbalance in this regulation resulting in a failure of T cells to undergo apoptosis and an accumulation of abnormal T cells. About SoquelitinibSoquelitinib (formerly CPI-818) is an investigational small molecule drug given orally designed to selectively inhibit ITK (interleukin-2-inducible T cell kinase), an enzyme that is expressed predominantly in T cells and plays a role in T cell and natural killer (NK) cell immune function. Soquelitinib has been shown to affect T cell differentiation and induce the generation of Th1 helper cells while blocking the development of both Th2 and Th17 cells and production of their secreted cytokines. Th1 T cells are required for immunity to tumors, viral infections and other infectious diseases. Th2 and Th17 helper T cells are involved in the pathogenesis of many autoimmune and allergic diseases. The Company believes the inhibition of specific molecular targets in T cells may be of therapeutic benefit for patients with cancers, including solid tumors, and in patients with autoimmune and allergic diseases. Recent studies have demonstrated that ITK controls a switch between the differentiation of Th17 proinflammatory cells and T regulatory suppressor cells. Inhibition of ITK leads to a shift toward T regulatory cell differentiation which has the potential to suppress autoimmune and inflammatory reactions. Based on interim results from a Phase 1/1b clinical trial in patients with refractory T cell lymphomas, which demonstrated tumor responses in very advanced, refractory, difficult to treat T cell malignancies, the Company has initiated a registrational Phase 3 clinical trial (NCT06561048) of soquelitinib in patients with relapsed PTCL. Soquelitinib is also being investigated in a randomized placebo-controlled phase 1 clinical trial in patients with atopic dermatitis. A recent publication describing the chemistry, enzymology and biology of soquelitinib appeared in npj Drug Discovery in December 2024 and is available online at the Nature website and on the Publications and Presentations page of the Corvus website. About Corvus PharmaceuticalsCorvus Pharmaceuticals is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company pioneering the development of ITK inhibition as a new approach to immunotherapy for a broad range of cancer and immune diseases. The Company’s lead product candidate is soquelitinib, an investigational, oral, small molecule drug that selectively inhibits ITK.

MIPLYFFA has also been shown to reduce unesterified cholesterol in the lysosomes of human NPC fibroblasts. The clinical significance of these findings is not fully understood. In the pivotal phase 3 trial, MIPLYFFA halted disease progression compared to placebo over the one-year duration of the trial when measured by the only validated disease progression measurement tool, the NPC Clinical Severity Scale. MIPLYFFA has also received Orphan Medicinal Product designation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of NPC. INDICATIONS AND USAGE MIPLYFFA is indicated for use in combination with miglustat for the treatment of neurological manifestations of Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) in adult and pediatric patients 2 years of age and older. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION Hypersensitivity Reactions:Hypersensitivity reactions such as urticaria and angioedema have been reported in patients treated with MIPLYFFA during Trial 1: two patients reported both urticaria and angioedema (6%) and one patient (3%) experienced urticaria alone within the first two months of treatment. Discontinue MIPLYFFA in patients who develop severe hypersensitivity reactions. If a mild or moderate hypersensitivity reaction occurs, stop MIPLYFFA and treat promptly. Monitor the patient until signs and symptoms resolve. Embryofetal Toxicity:MIPLYFFA may cause embryofetal harm when administered during pregnancy based on findings from animal reproduction studies. Advise pregnant females of the potential risk to the fetus and consider pregnancy planning and prevention for females of reproductive potential. Increased Creatinine without Affecting Glomerular Function:Across clinical trials of MIPLYFFA, mean increases in serum creatinine of 10% to 20% compared to baseline were reported. These increases occurred mostly in the first month of MIPLYFFA treatment and were not associated with changes in glomerular function. During MIPLYFFA treatment, use alternative measures that are not based on creatinine to assess renal function. Increases in creatinine reversed upon MIPLYFFA discontinuation. The most common adverse reactions in Trial 1 (≥15%) in MIPLYFFA-treated patients who also received miglustat were upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhea, and decreased weight. Three (6%) of the MIPLYFFA-treated patients had the following adverse reactions that led to withdrawal from Trial 1: increased serum creatinine (one patient), and progressive urticaria and angioedema (two patients). Serious adverse reactions reported in MIPLYFFA-treated patients were hypersensitivity reactions including urticaria and angioedema. To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Zevra Therapeutics, Inc. at toll-free phone 1-844-600-2237 or FDA at 1‑800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. Drug Interaction(s):Arimoclomol is an inhibitor of the organic cationic transporter 2 (OCT2) transporter and may increase the exposure of drugs that are OCT2 substrates. When MIPLYFFA is used concomitantly with OCT2 substrates, monitor for adverse reactions and reduce the dosage of the OCT2 substrate. Use in Females and Males of Reproductive Potential:Based on animal findings, MIPLYFFA may impair fertility and may increase post-implantation loss and reduce maternal, placental, and fetal weights. Renal Impairment:The recommended dosage of MIPLYFFA, in combination with miglustat, in patients with an eGFR ≥15 mL/minute to <50 mL/minute is lower than the recommended dosage (less frequent dosing) in patients with normal renal function. MIPLYFFA capsules for oral use are available in the following strengths: 47 mg, 62 mg, 93 mg, and 124 mg.

"Dogwood Therapeutics, Inc. Announces Conversion of Existing $19.5M in Debt to Equity, Strengthening Balance Sheet Moving Forward","March 12, 2025 08:30 ET","ATLANTA, March  12, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Dogwood Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: DWTX) (“Dogwood” or the “Company”), a development-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on advancing first-in-class, non-opioid, treatments for chronic and acute pain, announces that its largest shareholder, CK Life Sciences Int’l., (Holdings), Inc. (“CKLS”) has agreed, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Conjoint Inc. (“Conjoint”), to assign to the Company all outstanding indebtedness under the previously existing $19.5 million Loan Agreement plus accrued interest in exchange for 284.2638 shares of preferred equity of the Company, effective today. “We believe the decision by CKLS to exchange the outstanding loan amounts for equity in the Company is anchored to its conviction in Halneuron®, NaV 1.7 as a priority target for reducing pain. The conversion further underscores its confidence in the Dogwood management teams’ ability to execute the Halneuron® Phase 2b chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain (“CINP”) program,” said Greg Duncan, Dogwood’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “This agreement enables us to remove all existing debt from our balance sheet, which, combined with the potential for Halneuron® to be the first FDA approved therapy to treat CINP, we believe makes us a more attractive investment opportunity moving forward.” The strategic financing, initially provided by CKLS in October 2024, ensures the Company has sufficient capital to recruit patients through a planned interim assessment of its ongoing Phase 2b CINP trial in Q4 of this year without the burden of making debt payments as originally structured. Dosing of the first patient in its Phase 2b clinical trial, referred to as the HALT-CINP (Halneuron® Treatment of Chemotherapy-Induced Neuropathic Pain) trial, is anticipated in the near term. Pursuant to the Debt Exchange and Cancellation Agreement entered into between Conjoint and the Company on March 12, 2025, the principal amount of all loans made to the Company under the Loan Agreement, along with accrued interest through March 12, 2025, will be deemed repaid by the Company and all of the Company’s obligations with respect to the principal amount and accrued interest will be satisfied in full and cancelled. In exchange, the Company has agreed to issue to Conjoint 284.2638 shares of Series A-1 Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“A-1 Preferred Stock”). Each share of A-1 Preferred Stock will be convertible into 10,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, subject to and contingent upon approval of the Company’s stockholders and relevant Nasdaq rules and regulations. The terms of the A-1 Preferred Stock are substantially the same as the Company’s Series A Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock, except that the terms of the A-1 Preferred Stock do not provide for any cash settlement or dividend rights. Halneuron® is a first-in-class, NaV 1.7 specific voltage gated sodium channel inhibitor being developed as an alternative to chronic pain treatment with opioids. Patients treated with Halneuron® demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in cancer-related pain in a previous Phase 2 clinical trial with an acceptable safety profile. Halneuron® has been evaluated in over 700 patients in a series of Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies and shows no signs of addiction potential. About Dogwood Therapeutics Dogwood Therapeutics (Nasdaq: DWTX) is a development-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing new medicines to treat pain and fatigue-related disorders. The Dogwood research pipeline includes two separate mechanistic platforms with a non-opioid analgesic program and an antiviral program. The proprietary, non-opioid, NaV 1.7 analgesic program is centered on our lead development candidate, Halneuron®, which is a highly specific voltage-gated sodium channel modulator, a mechanism known to be effective for reducing pain transmission. In clinical studies, Halneuron® treatment has demonstrated pain reduction in pain related to general cancer and in pain related to chronic chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain (“CINP”). Interim data from the forthcoming Halneuron® Phase 2 CINP study are expected in Q4 of 2025. Dogwood’s antiviral program includes IMC-1 and IMC-2, which are novel, proprietary, fixed-dose combinations of anti-herpes antivirals and the anti-inflammatory agent celecoxib. These combination antiviral approaches are being applied to the treatment of illnesses believed to be related to reactivation of previously dormant herpesviruses, including fibromyalgia (“FM”) and Long-COVID (“LC”). IMC-1 is poised to progress into Phase 3 development as a treatment for FM and is the focus of external partnership activities. IMC-2 has been assessed in both active control and double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials and, in both cases, demonstrated successful reduction of the fatigue associated with LC. The company has reached an agreement with FDA on using reduction in fatigue as the primary endpoint for future LC research and is currently planning to advance IMC-2 into Phase 2b research.

Roche enters into an exclusive collaboration & licensing agreement with Zealand Pharma to co-develop and co-commercialise petrelintide as a potential foundational therapy for people with overweight and obesity,"March 12, 2025 02:00 ET","Basel, 12 March 2025 - Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) announced today that it has entered into an exclusive collaboration and licensing agreement with Zealand Pharma (Nasdaq Copenhagen: ZEAL) (CVR-no. 20045078). Under the terms of this agreement, the two companies will collaborate to co-develop and co-commercialise petrelintide, Zealand Pharma’s amylin analog as a standalone therapy as well as a fixed-dose combination with Roche’s lead incretin asset CT-388. In recent years, scientific advances in the field of incretins and an increased understanding of the disease biology have significantly changed the possibilities to treat obesity and its numerous associated health conditions (comorbidities). With these advances, a large opportunity remains to provide new treatments that offer improved efficacy, safety, quality, and durability of weight loss. Petrelintide, currently in phase 2 clinical development, is a long-acting amylin analog suitable for once-weekly subcutaneous administration. The available clinical data suggests its potential to become a best-in-class amylin monotherapy, with improved tolerability compared to current weight management treatments and to expand into adjacent indications. The combination of petrelintide with Roche’s dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonist CT-388 will further strengthen and expand Roche’s pipeline in the field of cardiovascular, renal, and metabolic (CVRM) diseases. This combination offers the opportunity for best-in-disease efficacy while potentially offering enhanced tolerability. Teresa Graham, CEO Roche Pharmaceuticals: “We are excited to collaborate with Zealand Pharma and develop this promising therapy, which we hope will provide people living with obesity and related comorbidities a new treatment option. We share the vision to develop petrelintide as a future foundational therapy. By combining petrelintide with our Pharmaceuticals portfolio and with our Diagnostics expertise in cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, we are aiming to transform the standard of care and positively impact patients’ lives.” Adam Steensberg, President and Chief Executive Officer of Zealand Pharma: “We are thrilled to announce this transformational partnership, aiming to maximise the full value of petrelintide to the benefit of people living with overweight and obesity. With relentless focus on innovation, a global manufacturing network and commercial reach, a complementary portfolio of clinical programmes in obesity, and importantly a shared vision for petrelintide, we consider Roche the ideal partner for Zealand Pharma. We strongly believe that petrelintide holds potential as a foundational therapy for weight management, addressing unmet medical needs among the majority of people living with overweight and obesity, both as stand-alone therapy and in combination with other agents. This collaboration with Roche is a step change to realise this vision, while solidifying Zealand Pharma as a key player in the future management of obesity”. Terms of the AgreementThis collaboration agreement covers the co-development and co-commercialisation of petrelintide to unlock the full value of the asset. As a part of this agreement, Zealand Pharma and Roche will co-commercialise petrelintide in the U.S. and Europe, whereas Roche will obtain exclusive rights to commercialisation in the rest of the world. Roche will be responsible for commercial manufacturing and supply. Under the terms of the agreement, Zealand Pharma will receive upfront cash payments of USD 1.65 billion, including USD 1.4 billion due upon closing and USD 250 million over the first two anniversaries of the collaboration. Zealand Pharma is also eligible for development milestones of USD 1.2 billion primarily linked to initiation of Phase 3 trials with petrelintide monotherapy and sales-based milestones of USD 2.4 billion, for a total consideration to Zealand Pharma of up to USD 5.3 billion. Profits and losses for petrelintide and petrelintide/CT-388 will be shared on a 50/50 basis in the U.S. and Europe, and Zealand Pharma is eligible to receive tiered double-digit royalties up to high teens % royalties on net sales in the rest of the world. Zealand Pharma will pay Roche USD 350 million, offsettable against milestone payments, for the petrelintide/CT-388 fixed-dose combination product or next-generation petrelintide combination products being pursued under the collaboration agreement. The closing of the transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. The parties expect that the transaction will close in Q2 2025. About petrelintidePetrelintide is a long-acting amylin analog suitable for once-weekly subcutaneous administration that has been designed with chemical and physical stability with no fibrillation around neutral pH, allowing for co-formulation and co-administration with other peptides. Amylin is produced in pancreatic beta cells and co-secreted with insulin in response to ingested nutrients. Amylin receptor activation has been shown to reduce body weight by restoring sensitivity to the satiety hormone leptin, inducing a sense of feeling full faster. Current clinical data and pre-clinical data suggest a potential of petrelintide to deliver weight loss comparable to GLP-1 receptor agonists but with improved tolerability for a better patient experience and high-quality weight loss. Petrelintide is being evaluated in Phase 2b clinical trials. ZUPREME-1 is for people with obesity/overweight without type 2 diabetes (T2D) and was initiated in December 2024 (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT06662539). ZUPREME-2 is for people with obesity/overweight with T2D and is expected to be initiated in the first half of 2025. About CT-388CT-388 is a once-weekly subcutaneous injectable, dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonist being developed for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). CT-388 was designed to have potent activity on both the GLP-1 and GIP receptors but with minimal to no ß-arrestin recruitment on either receptor. This biased signalling significantly minimises receptor internalisation and consequent desensitisation, which is expected to lead to prolonged pharmacological activity. CT-388 is currently being studied in Phase 2b clinical trials in people with overweight/obesity with and without type 2 diabetes. About obesityObesity is one of the most extensive health challenges in the world and an area where recent scientific advances can help meet the high unmet medical need. This condition is associated with over 200 comorbidities, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, fatty liver, and chronic kidney disease, which together place an enormous strain on healthcare systems worldwide. Over 4 billion people are estimated to be obese or overweight by 2035, approaching 50% of the world’s population.

"Alpha Pro Tech, Ltd. Announces Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Financial Results","March 12, 2025 09:00 ET","NOGALES, Ariz., March  12, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Alpha Pro Tech, Ltd. (NYSE American: APT), a leading manufacturer of products designed to protect people, products and environments, including disposable protective apparel and building products, today announced financial results for the three month period and full year, ended December 31, 2024. Lloyd Hoffman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Alpha Pro Tech, commented, “The housing market continues to show weakness, with housing starts down 4.4% in 2024 compared to 2023. Although sales of the core building products (housewrap and synthetic roof underlayment), were down 7.9% in 2024, exceeding the decline in housing starts, we are optimistic about the future for the following reasons. Excluding the decline of sales by two private label distributors, the 2024 sales performance of our core building products would have resulted in a lower percentage decline then the reduction in housing starts, indicating that we otherwise outperformed the overall market. Housewrap sales were encouraging through the first nine months of 2024, especially since the percentage decline of housing starts was higher than the percentage decline of housewrap sales of 2.6%. Lower housewrap sales in the final quarter of 2024, were primarily due to one of our larger distributors losing business from certain end users, but we have not lost share with this distributor. Presenting an additional challenge in 2024, multi-family housing starts in 2024 were down 11.3% compared to 2023 with 2024 being the lowest in ten years. Sales of synthetic roof underlayment, which were down double digits through the first nine months of 2024, ended the year down single digits. After hurricanes Helene and Milton, we saw a surge in synthetic roof underlayment orders in the fourth quarter of 2024 to assist in the southeast rebuild. Sales of this product line continue to be affected by uncertain economic conditions, more offshore competition and a push in the market to reduce product selling prices. We expect growth in 2025 in the synthetic roof underlayment category. Despite the challenges faced in 2024, our efforts are now focused on builders and contractors and we are educating the industry on our extensive manufacturing capabilities which are expected to contribute to future growth. Our top fifteen accounts have increased sales compared to 2023, excluding one of our top accounts mentioned above. This is a testament to the hard work and commitment of our sales team. Late in the year, we added two Territory Mangers that will assist in strengthening relationships with our customers and driving new business. Sales of other woven material decreased by $1.3 million, or 28.2% in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to one of our customers being acquired by another company. We are pursuing new opportunities for other woven material sales that could improve sales. We have recently created the position of Director of Product and Business Development. This role will be instrumental in helping us expand our product offerings and explore new opportunities and industries where we currently do not have a presence. Management expects growth in the Building Supply segment in the coming year, as the projected number of housing starts in 2025 is expected to increase. However, there continues to be uncertainty in housing starts and the economy in general that could affect this segment.” Mr. Hoffman continued, “Sales of disposable protective garments in 2024 were up approximately 19% as compared to pre-pandemic levels, increasing due to further integration and growth among some of our largest regional channel partners. We have signed new distribution agreements with regional and national channel partners, which should provide for an enhanced level of engagement and mutual growth incentives. In addition, we signed a new agreement with our largest international channel partner and achieved elevated status and were named as a preferred supplier going forward. We believe this achievement will provide some growth opportunities, and management expects continued growth for disposable protective garments in 2025.” 2024 Results Consolidated sales for the three months ended December 31, 2024 decreased to $13.8 million, from $15.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, representing a decrease of $1.5 million, or 9.5%. Building Supply segment sales for the three months ended December 31, 2024, decreased by $800,000, or 8.1%, to $9.0 million, compared to $9.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023. This decrease during the three months ended December 31, 2024 was primarily due to a 16.9% decrease in sales of housewrap and a 17.6% decrease in sales of other woven material, partially offset by an increase in sales of synthetic roof underlayment of 5%, compared to the same period of 2023. Disposable Protective Apparel segment sales for the three months ended December 31, 2024 decreased by $700,000, or 11.9%, to $4.8 million, compared to $5.5 million for the same period of 2023. This decrease was due to a 13.9% decrease in sales of disposable protective garments and a 2.2% decrease in sales of face masks, slightly offset by a 1.4% increase in face shield sales. Consolidated sales for the year ended December 31, 2024, decreased to $57.8 million, from $61.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, representing a decrease of $3.4 million, or 5.5%. Building Supply segment sales for the year ended December 31, 2024, decreased by $4.4 million, or 11.0%, to $36.0 million compared to $40.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to a 6.4% decrease in sales of housewrap, an 8.8% decrease in sales of synthetic roof underlayment and a 28.2% decrease in sales of other woven material, compared to the same period of 2023. Disposable Protective Apparel segment sales for the year ended December 31, 2024, increased by $1.0 million or 5.0%, to $21.9 million, compared to $20.8 million for 2023. This increase was due to a 0.8% increase in sales of disposable protective garments and a 43.5% increase in sales of face shields, partially offset by a 34.6% decrease in sales of face masks. Gross Profit Gross profit decreased by $516,000, or 9.0%, to $5.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2024, from $5.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023. The gross profit margin was 37.6% for the three months ended December 31, 2024, compared to 37.4% for the three months ended December 31, 2023. Gross profit increased by $104,000, or 0.5%, to $22.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, from $22.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The gross profit margin was 39.6% for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to 37.3% for the year ended December 31, 2023. The gross profit margin in 2024 was positively affected by a margin increase in both the Disposable Protective Apparel and Building Supply segments. However, management expects that the gross profit margin could be negatively affected during 2025 by ocean freight rates that experienced significant volatility in 2024, due to factors such as geopolitical tensions, labor disputes and market dynamics. As we progress into next year, the outlook suggests continued volatility and unpredictability in freight rates. Net Income Net income for the three months ended December 31, 2024 was $847,000, compared to net income of $1.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, representing a decrease of $214,000, or 20.2%. Net income as a percentage of net sales for the three months ended December 31, 2024 was 6.1%, and net income as a percentage of net sales for the same period of 2023 was 7.0%. Basic and diluted earnings per common share for the three months ended December 31, 2024, and 2023 were $0.08 and $0.09, respectively. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2024, was $3.9 million compared to net income of $4.2 million for 2023, representing a decrease of $260,000, or 6.2%. The net income decrease between 2024 and 2023 was due to a decrease in income before provision for income taxes of $405,000, partially offset by a decrease in provision for income taxes of $145,000. Net income as a percentage of net sales was 6.8% for both years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. Basic and diluted earnings per common share for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, were $0.35. Balance Sheet As of December 31, 2024, the Company had cash of $18.6 million compared to $20.4 million as of December 31, 2023. Working capital totaled $47.5 million and the Company’s current ratio was 16:1, compared to a current ratio of 21:1 as of December 31, 2023. Colleen McDonald, Chief Financial Officer, commented, “As of December 31, 2024, we had $2.7 million available for additional stock purchases under our stock repurchase program.

Iolyx Therapeutics to Present at Multiple Upcoming Ophthalmology Conferences,"March 12, 2025 08:30 ET","BURLINGAME, Calif., March  12, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Iolyx Therapeutics, a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the development of therapeutics at the intersection of ocular inflammation and autoimmunity, today announced acceptance of abstracts in four upcoming industry events, where the company will present new developments and updates on its lead candidate, ILYX-002, for immune-driven dry eye disease (DED) from a recent Phase 2 clinical trial, ILYX-002-201. Autoimmune and inflammatory diseases are commonly associated with ocular comorbidities for which currently available treatments are limited regarding efficacy, safety, and ease of administration, and thus do little to improve ocular treatment outcomes for patients. ILYX-002 is a potent and selective topically administered immune modulator designed to address the root immune-ophthalmologic pathology of these comorbidities, beginning with DED, while delivering a safe and tolerable response and convenient administration. Updates on ILYX-002 will be the focus of the upcoming Iolyx presentations, for which further details can be found below. Sonoma Eye Meeting Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) Annual Meeting British Contact Lens Association (BCLA) Clinical Conference 18th Annual International Ocular and Inflammation Society (IOIS) Meeting About ILYX-002-201 ILYX-002-201 is a first-in-human Phase 2 clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of ILYX-002 in patients with moderate-to-severe dry eye disease (DED) associated with systemic autoimmune or inflammatory disorders. Conducted across multiple sites in Australia, this randomized, double-masked, and vehicle-controlled study included 105 participants randomized to receive either ILYX-002 or vehicle control, administered twice daily (BID) for eight weeks, followed by a two-week safety follow up. The primary and secondary endpoints were focused on safety and the signs of DED evaluated using objective staining measures on the ocular surface. About ILYX-002 ILYX-002 is a broadly acting, potent, and specific immune-modulator acting on the Th17 and Th1 dysregulation commonly present in inflammatory ocular surface diseases. The product is presented as a sterile, preservative-free ophthalmic suspension, used twice a day. By targeting the underlying Th17/Th1 biologic pathways locally, ILYX-002 aims to provide rapid, robust, and sustained relief without the long-term safety and tolerability concerns often associated with steroid therapies. About Iolyx Therapeutics Iolyx Therapeutics is an immuno-ophthalmology company dedicated to transforming the standard of care at the intersection of ocular inflammation and autoimmunity, from the cornea and anterior chamber to the retina. With optimized, locally administered formulations tailored to deliver potent therapeutics to relevant ocular tissues, Iolyx targets ocular inflammation at the source. Iolyx’s mission is to develop targeted therapeutics that maximize efficacy and convenience, with excellent tolerability, and the aim to displace steroids and older immunosuppressants for the benefit of a broad cross-section of patients.

Solid Biosciences to Present at the 2025 Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA) Clinical & Scientific Conference,"March 12, 2025 08:00 ET","CHARLESTOWN, Mass., March  12, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Solid Biosciences Inc. (Nasdaq: SLDB), a life sciences company developing precision genetic medicines for neuromuscular and cardiac diseases, will present data from the Phase 1/2 INSPIRE DUCHENNE trial evaluating SGT-003, a next-generation gene therapy product candidate intended for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (Duchenne), at the 2025 Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA) Clinical & Scientific Conference, taking place in Dallas, TX, March 16-19, 2025. Oral PresentationTitle: Initial Experience from the INSPIRE DUCHENNE Phase I/II Study of SGT-003 Microdystrophin Gene Therapy for Duchenne Muscular DystrophyLocation/Room: Coronado ABCDDate/Time: March 19, 2025; 1:45 - 2:00pm CTPresenter: Kevin Flanigan, MD, Advisor Consultant & Researcher, Nationwide Children’s Hospital About DuchenneDuchenne is a genetic muscle-wasting disease predominantly affecting boys, with symptoms usually appearing between three and five years of age. Duchenne is a progressive, irreversible, and ultimately fatal disease that affects approximately one in every 3,500 to 5,000 live male births and has an estimated prevalence of 5,000 to 15,000 cases in the United States alone. About SGT-003SGT-003 is an investigational gene therapy containing a differentiated microdystrophin construct and a proprietary, next-generation capsid, AAV-SLB101, which was rationally designed to target integrin receptors, and has shown enhanced cardiac and skeletal muscle transduction with decreased liver targeting in nonclinical studies. SGT-003’s microdystrophin construct uniquely includes the R16/17 domains, which localize nNOS to the muscle. Nonclinical studies have shown that nNOS can improve blood flow to the muscle thereby reducing muscle breakdown from ischemia and muscle fatigue. Together, these design features suggest that SGT-003 could be a potential best-in-class investigational gene therapy for the treatment of Duchenne. About INSPIRE DUCHENNEINSPIRE DUCHENNE is a first-in-human, open-label, single-dose, multicenter Phase 1/2 clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of SGT-003 in pediatric participants with a genetically confirmed Duchenne diagnosis with a documented dystrophin gene mutation. INSPIRE DUCHENNE is a multinational trial designed to enroll participants in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Italy. About Solid BiosciencesSolid Biosciences is a precision genetic medicine company focused on advancing a portfolio of gene therapy candidates targeting rare neuromuscular and cardiac diseases, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy (Duchenne), Friedreich’s ataxia (FA), catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), TNNT2-mediated dilated cardiomyopathy, BAG3-mediated dilated cardiomyopathy, and additional fatal, genetic cardiac diseases. The Company is also focused on developing innovative libraries of genetic regulators and other enabling technologies with promising potential to significantly impact gene therapy delivery cross-industry. Solid is advancing its diverse pipeline and delivery platform in the pursuit of uniting experts in science, technology, disease management, and care. Patient-focused and founded by those directly impacted by Duchenne, Solid’s mission is to improve the daily lives of patients living with devastating rare diseases.

Portage Biotech Resumes Enrollment in Final Cohort of Dose Escalation for Port-6 in ADPORT-601 Trial,"March 12, 2025 08:00 ET","DOVER, Del., March  12, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Portage Biotech Inc. (“Portage” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: PRTG), a clinical-stage immuno-oncology company with a portfolio of innovative therapeutics, today announced the resumption of patient enrollment in the fourth and final cohort of the dose escalation stage for PORT-6, a highly selective A2A antagonist, within its ADPORT-601 Phase 1b clinical trial. Portage had previously paused this trial due to funding concerns; this resumption of the trial underscores the encouraging findings observed in earlier cohorts. After the completion of the PORT-6 arm of the ADPORT-601 study, Portage will evaluate the continuation of the study into its PORT-7 (potent and selective A2B antagonist) and combination arms, on a segment-by-segment basis. Advancing to this final dose escalation reaffirms Portage’s confidence in the safety and therapeutic potential of PORT-6, bringing the Company closer to identifying an optimal dose range for further clinical development. “Our review of the preliminary data reinforces our confidence in PORT-6 and supports the decision to complete dose escalation,” said Alexander Pickett, Chief Executive Officer of Portage Biotech. “We remain encouraged by the trial’s progress and potential and look forward to sharing further clinical updates later this year.” Combining PORT-6 and PORT-7 for a More Comprehensive Immunotherapy Approach In parallel, Portage is making final preparations for PORT-7, a potent and selective A2B antagonist, before dose escalation can commence in the same trial. The planned co-administration of PORT-6 and PORT-7 in ADPORT-601 will mark the first time two highly selective A2A and A2B antagonists are combined in patients, aiming to achieve a complete blockade of adenosine-induced immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment. This innovative approach is designed to fully neutralize adenosine-mediated immune suppression, enhance anti-tumor responses, and broaden the impact of immunotherapy in solid tumors.

Learn more at maxcyte.com and follow us on X and LinkedIn. Non-GAAP Financial Measures This press release contains EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure defined as earnings before interest income and expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization. MaxCyte believes that EBITDA provides useful information to management and investors relating to its results of operations. The company’s management uses this non-GAAP measure to compare the company’s performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses, and for budgeting and planning purposes. The company believes that the use of EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing the company’s financial measures with other companies, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors, and that it allows for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. This press release also contains Non-GAAP Gross Margin, which we define as Gross Margin when excluding SPL program related revenue and reserves for excess and obsolete inventory. The Company believes that the use of Non-GAAP Gross Margin provides an additional tool to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance, as Non-GAAP Gross Margin excludes non-core revenues and inventory reserves, which can vary significantly between periods and thus affect comparability. Management does not consider these Non-GAAP financial measures in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitation of these Non-GAAP financial measures is that they exclude significant revenues and expenses that are required by GAAP to be recorded in the Company’s financial statements. In order to compensate for these limitations, management presents these Non-GAAP financial measures along with GAAP results. Non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. Reconciliation tables of net loss, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, to EBITDA, and Gross Margin, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, to Non-GAAP Gross Margin, are included at the end of this release. MaxCyte urges investors to review the reconciliation and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the company’s business Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the ""safe harbor"" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

(Nasdaq: HBIO) (the “Company”) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2024. Jim Green, Chairman and CEO, said, “Our fourth quarter saw sequential strengthening in pre-clinical revenues across all regions, while our cellular and molecular technology (CMT) revenues were down slightly from the third quarter, primarily due to reduced purchasing by US academic customers. As expected, our fourth quarter revenues were down compared to the fourth quarter of last year as we navigated a challenging market environment. Green continued, “We are encouraged by the strong market reception of our new products by prominent academic institutions, contract research organizations and biopharma customers. In particular, we are seeing strong interest in our new SoHo™ telemetry systems and emerging growth of our breakthrough MeshMEA™ organoid systems. Finally, in the current market uncertainty, we remain focused on managing costs to improve our operating and financial performance.” Fourth Quarter 2024 Results For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company reported revenues of $24.6 million compared to $28.2 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. Gross margin for the three months ended December 31, 2024 was 57.1%, compared to 58.0% in 2023, with the year-over-year decrease due to lower absorption of fixed manufacturing costs and the impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by more favorable product mix and the impact of cost containment actions. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2024 was $18 thousand compared to a loss of $(1.8) million in the fourth quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2024 was $3.0 million compared to $3.6 million in the fourth quarter of the prior year.   Cash provided by operations was $1.7 million during the three months ended December 31, 2024, compared to $4.3 million in the same period in 2023. Results for Year Ended December 31, 2024 For the year ended December 31, 2024, revenues were $94.1 million compared to $112.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Revenues declined as a result of a challenging global market and reduced spending by CROs, distributors and academic research institutions. Gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2024 was 58.2%, compared to gross margin of 58.9% in the prior year. Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2024 was ($12.4) million compared to net loss of $(3.4) million for the year ended 2023, primarily due to the impact of lower revenues, which was partially offset by lower manufacturing and operating expenses due to cost reduction actions taken throughout the year. The Company’s net loss for 2024 includes a loss on equity securities of ($1.6) million compared to $(0.6) million in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $7.2 million, compared to adjusted EBITDA of $14.6 million for the year ended 2023. Cash provided by operations was $1.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $14.0 million in the year ended in 2023.

Amarin Announces Plan to Initiate a Ratio Change Under Its American Depository Receipt (ADR) Program,"March 12, 2025 07:01 ET","DUBLIN and BRIDGEWATER, N.J., March  12, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Amarin Corporation plc (NASDAQ: AMRN), today announced its intent to effect a ratio change on its American Depositary Shares (“ADS”) from one (1) ADS representing one (1) ordinary share, to the new ratio of one (1) ADS representing twenty (20) ordinary shares (the ""Ratio Change""). The effective date of the Ratio Change is expected to be on or about April 11, 2025 (the “Effective Date”).​ The ordinary shares of Amarin Corporation (the “Company”) will not be affected by this adjustment. The ADSs will continue to trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “AMRN”.​ The objective of the Ratio Change is to increase the per share market price of the Company’s ADSs to comply with Nasdaq’s $1.00 minimum bid price per share requirement and maintain the Company’s listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. On the Effective Date, holders of uncertificated ADSs in the Direct Registration System (“DRS”) and in the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) do not need to take any action, as the exchange of every twenty (20) then-held (existing) ADSs for one (1) new ADS will occur automatically. Registered holders of certificated ADSs will be required to surrender their certificated ADSs to the depositary bank for cancellation and will receive one (1) new ADS for every twenty (20) existing ADS surrendered. No fractional new ADSs will be issued in connection with the Ratio Change. Rather, fractional entitlements to new ADSs will be aggregated and sold by the depositary bank, and the net cash proceeds from the sale of the fractional ADS entitlements (after deduction of taxes) will be distributed to the applicable ADS holders by the depositary bank. As a result of the Ratio Change, the trading price of the Company’s ADSs is expected to increase proportionally, but the Company can give no assurance that the trading price per ADS after the Ratio Change will be equal to or greater than twenty (20) times the trading price per ADS before the adjustment.

NeuroOne® Accelerates Timeline of 510(k) Submission to FDA for the OneRF® Trigeminal Nerve Ablation System to Treat Facial Pain,"March 11, 2025 09:00 ET","Submission for New Intended Use That Leverages Company’s Patented OneRF® Technology Platform Expected in May 2025 EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn., March  11, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NeuroOne Medical Technologies Corporation (Nasdaq: NMTC) (""NeuroOne"" or the ""Company""), a medical technology company focused on improving surgical care options and outcomes for patients suffering from neurological disorders, has accelerated the anticipated timeline of its 510(k) submission to the FDA for trigeminal nerve ablation to May 2025, which leverages the Company’s patented OneRF® Technology Platform. The Company had previously projected a submission by the end of June 2025. Trigeminal nerve ablation is a minimally invasive surgical procedure that uses radiofrequency (RF) energy to destroy abnormal tissue to relieve severe, chronic pain in the face caused by trigeminal neuralgia. The trigeminal nerve is the main sensory nerve in the face and NeuroOne’s procedure is designed to provide pain relief for this condition. According to the October 2024 Research and Markets report titled Trigeminal Neuralgia Therapeutics Market, the trigeminal neuralgia therapeutics market, comprised of pharmacologic and surgical technologies, is expected to grow from $262 million in 2024 to over $416 million by 2030, primarily due to an aging population. “Building on the success of our three product families that have already achieved 510(k) FDA clearance, we have accelerated our submission timeline for the OneRF Trigeminal Nerve Ablation System, approximately two months ahead of schedule,” said Dave Rosa, President and Chief Executive Officer of NeuroOne. “If cleared by the FDA—we believe there is a potential to generate revenues from trigeminal nerve ablation in late 2025, which was not previously expected in calendar year 2025. “Importantly, trigeminal nerve ablation would be the second radiofrequency ablation technology in our portfolio leveraging our patented OneRF® Technology Platform. As we move ahead, we believe there are several additional ablation applications we can introduce and look forward to updating you on our progress as we move throughout the year.” About NeuroOne NeuroOne Medical Technologies Corporation (Nasdaq: NMTC) is developing and commercializing minimally invasive and hi-definition solutions for EEG recording, brain stimulation and ablation solutions for patients suffering from epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease, dystonia, essential tremors, chronic pain due to failed back surgeries and other related neurological disorders that may improve patient outcomes and reduce procedural costs.

Theratechnologies CROI Presentation Highlights Limitations of Using BMI to Assess Cardiovascular (CV) Risk in People with HIV,"March 12, 2025 07:30 ET","MONTREAL, March  12, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Theratechnologies Inc. (“Theratechnologies” or the “Company”) (TSX: TH) (NASDAQ: THTX), a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company, today presented data highlighting the limitations of using body mass index (BMI) alone in assessing cardiovascular (CV) risk in people with HIV (PWH). The study underscores the need to incorporate screening for excess visceral abdominal fat (EVAF) to better identify PWH at risk of CV disease. In a poster presentation at the 2025 Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI) in San Francisco, Calif., investigators from the Visceral Adiposity Measurement and Observation Study (VAMOS) characterized BMI as a poor independent surrogate for excess visceral adiposity and CV risk in PWH, particularly given the high CV risk observed in study participants with a normal or overweight BMI (“low BMI”) but high levels of EVAF. The investigators previously reported that EVAF is one of several risk factors that contribute to heightened CV risk in PWH who are on modern antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens. “There is abundant evidence of substantial weight gain and a high prevalence of obesity among people with HIV in the modern antiretroviral era,” commented lead VAMOS investigator Karam C. Mounzer, MD, Chief Scientific Officer at Philadelphia FIGHT Community Health Centers in Philadelphia, Pa. “Clinicians routinely use BMI as a marker to assess the risk of cardiovascular disease and other comorbidities in this population, but often overlook the importance of identifying excess visceral abdominal fat, or EVAF. Our findings not only suggest that relying solely on BMI underestimates cardiovascular risk but show a high prevalence of EVAF among patients with normal BMI which is an actual driver of such risk in people with HIV, that many clinicians fail to capture in their clinics.” VAMOS is a cross-sectional, multicenter, observational study investigating the relationships between BMI, EVAF (defined as a visceral adipose tissue [VAT] surface area ≥130 cm2), and CV risk factors in 170 PWH who had attained virological suppression on ART for at least one year. The investigators compared 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk scores across four distinct groups: Unsurprisingly, obese individuals (BMI 30-34.9 kg/m2) had the highest prevalence of EVAF (88%) in the study, followed by class II obese PWH (BMI 35-40 kg/m2; 69%). However, EVAF was still present in a substantial portion of PWH with normal BMI (20-25 kg/m2; 43%) and those classified as overweight (BMI 25-29.9 kg/m2; 47%). Notably, PWH with EVAF had higher 10-year ASCVD risk scores than those without EVAF, irrespective of BMI (p=0.0019). Additionally, high levels of pericardial fat volume (PFV, fat within the heart muscle) were found predominantly in participants with high EVAF, compared to those with low EVAF levels (p <0.0001). In a related finding, VAT area was more strongly correlated with PFV (Spearman r value = 0.73; p <0.0001) than with subcutaneous fat area (Spearman r = 0.2; p = 0.0109). “In addition to providing a predictive estimate of cardiovascular risk, the VAMOS findings show a substantial, real-time impact of fat in the body, as evidenced by the levels of pericardial fat volume,” noted Christian Marsolais, Ph.D., Senior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer of Theratechnologies. “The results also underscore that if healthcare providers focus solely on BMI, a sizeable population of normal-weight and overweight individuals with HIV and EVAF will be missed. We hope this study encourages the use of simple and more precise tools for assessing EVAF, such as measuring waist circumference, as a proven means of identifying people with HIV who are at risk of cardiovascular disease.” About Theratechnologies Theratechnologies (TSX: TH) (NASDAQ: THTX) is a specialty biopharmaceutical company focused on the commercialization of innovative therapies that have the potential to redefine standards of care.

Next-Gen Cancer Treatment: Rakovina’s AI-Driven ATR Inhibitors Enter Preclinical Testing,"March 12, 2025 08:30 ET","VANCOUVER, British Columbia, March  12, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rakovina Therapeutics Inc. (TSX-V: RKV)(FSE: 7JO), a biopharmaceutical company advancing innovative cancer therapies through artificial intelligence (AI)-powered drug discovery, announced today that the company has received the first synthesized batch of AI-generated ATR inhibitor compounds developed in collaboration with Variational AI. This milestone marks a significant step forward in Rakovina’s mission to accelerate drug discovery using advanced AI-driven platforms. In September 2024, Rakovina announced its partnership with Variational AI to leverage the Enki™ generative AI platform for the development of next-generation DNA Damage Response (DDR) inhibitors. Following a rigorous AI-driven selection process, the company shortlisted the most promising ATR inhibitor candidates for synthesis. The first batch of these compounds will now move into preclinical testing at Rakovina’s state-of-the-art, integrated wet lab for further evaluation and validation. Results from this phase will guide the selection of lead candidates for further optimization and potential clinical development. “We are excited to advance our first AI-designed ATR inhibitors into preclinical testing,” said Jeffrey Bacha, Executive Chairman of Rakovina Therapeutics. “This represents a major step in leveraging generative AI for drug discovery. The speed and precision of AI in identifying novel, high-potential compounds will significantly accelerate the development of next-generation cancer therapies.” Advancing the Fight Against ATR-Targeted Cancers ATR (Ataxia Telangiectasia and Rad3-related) inhibitors play a critical role in targeting cancers with DNA repair deficiencies, such as ovarian, breast, and prostate cancers. Despite the potential of ATR inhibitors, no FDA-approved treatments currently exist in this category. Rakovina’s AI-driven approach aims to address this gap by rapidly identifying and optimizing ATR-targeted compounds with strong therapeutic potential — including candidates designed to effectively cross the blood-brain barrier, offering new hope for patients with cancers that affect the central nervous system. About Rakovina Therapeutics Inc. Rakovina Therapeutics is a biopharmaceutical research company focused on the development of innovative cancer treatments. Our work is based on unique technologies for targeting the DNA-damage response powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI) using the proprietary Deep-Docking™ and Enki™ platforms.

Atsena Therapeutics Granted U.S. FDA Fast Track Designation for ATSN-201 Gene Therapy to Treat X-linked Retinoschisis,"March 12, 2025 07:30 ET","DURHAM, N.C., March  12, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Atsena Therapeutics, a clinical-stage gene therapy company focused on using the life-changing power of genetic medicine to reverse or prevent blindness, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Fast Track designation for ATSN-201 for the treatment of X-linked retinoschisis (XLRS). ATSN-201, a best-in-class gene therapy product candidate, leverages AAV.SPR, the company’s novel spreading capsid, to achieve therapeutic levels of gene expression in photoreceptors of the central retina while avoiding the surgical risks of foveal detachment. “We are pleased that the FDA has granted Fast Track designation to ATSN-201, reinforcing its potential to address the significant unmet need in XLRS, a rare inherited retinal disease with no approved treatments,” said Patrick Ritschel, Chief Executive Officer of Atsena Therapeutics. “This designation, along with the previously granted Orphan Drug and Rare Pediatric Disease designations, marks an important milestone in advancing the development of ATSN-201. The Atsena team remains dedicated to developing transformative gene therapies and improving the quality of life of individuals suffering from XLRS and other inherited retinal diseases.” Fast Track designation is granted to treatments intended to address serious or life-threatening diseases that have demonstrated the potential to meet an unmet medical need. Treatments that receive Fast Track designation may benefit from more frequent interactions with the FDA throughout drug development. In addition, the Fast Track program allows for Priority Review, if relevant criteria are met. Currently, there are no approved treatments for XLRS, which is typically diagnosed in early childhood and affects approximately 30,000 males in the U.S. and the EU. The safety and tolerability of ATSN-201 is currently being evaluated in the LIGHTHOUSE study, a Phase I/II, dose-escalation and dose-expansion clinical trial in male patients ages six and older with a clinical diagnosis of XLRS caused by mutations in the RS1 gene. Enrollment for this study is ongoing. For more information, visit ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT05878860). About X-linked Retinoschisis (XLRS)XLRS is a monogenic X-linked disease caused by mutations in the RS1 gene which encodes retinoschisin, a protein secreted primarily by photoreceptors. RS1 is localized to the extracellular surface of rods, cones, and bipolar cells. XLRS is characterized by schisis, or abnormal splitting of retinal layers, which causes impaired visual acuity that is not correctable with glasses and leads to progressive vision loss and ultimately blindness. XLRS primarily affects males and is typically diagnosed in early childhood. Approximately 30,000 males in the U.S. and EU have XLRS, for which there are currently no approved treatments. About AAV.SPRAAV.SPR, one of Atsena’s novel capsids, spreads laterally beyond the subretinal injection site to enable safe and efficient transduction of the central retina (where schisis cavities predominate in XLRS patient retinas) when injected into areas outside the macula. A preclinical study in non-human primates demonstrated that AAV.SPR promotes transgene expression well beyond subretinal injection bleb margins. This is in contrast to benchmark AAV vectors, which remain confined to the original bleb margins. At clinically relevant doses, AAV.SPR efficiently transduces foveal cones without the need for surgical detachment and has a favorable safety profile relative to benchmark capsids. For more information about the preclinical study and how AAV.SPR works, visit https://atsenatx.com/our-approach/laterally-spreading-aav/. About Atsena TherapeuticsAtsena Therapeutics (“Atsena”) is a clinical-stage gene therapy company developing best-in-class treatments for the reversal or prevention of blindness from inherited retinal diseases. The company’s lead program is evaluating ATSN-201 in an ongoing Phase I/II clinical trial for X-linked retinoschisis (XLRS), a genetic condition that is typically diagnosed in childhood and leads to blindness later in life. ATSN-101, Atsena’s first-in-class, investigational gene therapy for Leber congenital amaurosis type 1 (LCA1), one of the most common causes of blindness in children, has completed a Phase 1 / 2 trial with positive results (https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(24)01447-8). Atsena is advancing ATSN-101 toward the initiation of a global pivotal trial as part of its exclusive strategic collaboration with Nippon Shinyaku Co., Ltd. Atsena’s pipeline is powered by novel adeno-associated virus (AAV) technology tailored to overcome the hurdles presented by inherited retinal diseases. Founded by pioneers in ocular gene therapy, Atsena is led by an experienced team dedicated to addressing the needs of patients with vision loss.

Re 7) Election of AuditorsThe Board of Directors proposes that KPMG (CVR-nr. 25578198) is re-elected as the Company's auditor. The Board of Directors further proposes that the appointment of KPMG, as the Company’s auditor, includes the duty to audit and provide statement of assurance on the Company’s sustainability reporting. The proposal from the Board is made in accordance with the recommendation of the Finance, Risk and Audit Committee. The Finance, Risk and Audit Committee has been free from influence by a third party and has not been subject to any contract with a third party restricting the choice by the general meeting on the selection of a statutory auditor or an audit firm. Re 8a) Proposal to authorize the Board of Directors to increase the share capitalThe Board of Directors proposes to increase and extend the authorizations of the Board of Directors in Article 5a, subsections 1-3 of the Articles of Association, so that the Board of Directors during the period until 30 June 2026 is authorized to increase the share capital of the Company in one or more issues by a total of up to nominally DKK 78,854,850, corresponding to 10 % of the Company's share capital. The proposal entails amending Article 5a, subsections 1-3 of the Articles of Association as follows: ""Subsection 1For the period ending on 30 June 2026, the Board of Directors is authorized to increase the Company's share capital in one or more issues with a total of up to nominally DKK 78,854,850 (7,885,485 shares of DKK 10 each) by the subscription of new shares. The existing shareholders shall have pre-emption rights to subscribe for the amount by which the share capital is increased, proportional to their shareholdings. The share capital shall be increased by cash payment at a subscription price which may be lower than the value of the shares. The terms and conditions of the subscription for shares shall be determined by the Board of Directors. The new shares shall be negotiable instruments, shall be registered in the names of the holders and shall be entered in the Company's register of shareholders. No restrictions shall apply to the transferability of the new shares, and no shareholder shall be obliged to have his shares redeemed - in whole or in part. The shares shall carry the right to dividend as from the date fixed by the Board of Directors, but not later than the first financial year following the capital increase. Subsection 2For the period ending on 30 June 2026, the Board of Directors is authorized to increase the Company's share capital in one or more issues with a total of up to nominally DKK 78,854,850 (7,885,485 shares of DKK 10 each) by the subscription of new shares. The existing shareholders shall not have pre-emption rights to subscribe for the amount by which the share capital is increased. The share capital may be increased by cash payment or in other ways, such as by conversion of debts or in payment of a contribution in kind. The share capital shall in any event be increased at a subscription price, which is not lower than market value. The terms and conditions of the subscription for shares shall be determined by the Board of Directors. The new shares shall be negotiable instruments, shall be registered in the names of the holders and shall be entered in the Company's register of shareholders. No restrictions shall apply to the transferability of the new shares, and no shareholder shall be obliged to have his shares redeemed - in whole or in part. The shares shall carry the right to dividend as from the date fixed by the Board of Directors, but not later than the first financial year following the capital increase. Subsection 3When exercising the authorizations given in Articles 5a(1), 5a(2) and 5a(4) the Board of Directors is in total authorized to increase the share capital of the Company with a total of up to nominally DKK 78,854,850 (7,885,485 shares of DKK 10 each).” Re 8b) Proposal to authorize the Board of Directors to obtain loans against issuance of convertible notes which give the right to subscribe for new shares in the CompanyThe Board of Directors proposes to increase and extend the authorization of the Board of Directors in Article 5a, subsection 4 of the Articles of Association, so that the Board of Directors during the period until 30 June 2026 is authorized to obtain loans against issuance of convertible notes which give the right to subscribe for new shares in the Company and so that the Board of Directors is authorized to increase the share capital of the Company by up to nominally DKK 78,854,850, corresponding to 10 % of the Company's share capital. The proposal entails amending subsection 4 to Article 5a of the Articles of Association as follows: “Subsection 4For the period ending on 30 June 2026, the Board of Directors is authorized to obtain loans in the Company by issue of convertible notes that give the right to subscribe for new shares in the Company by a maximum nominal value of up to DKK 78,854,850. The Company's existing shareholders shall not have pre-emption rights to grant loans. The loans shall be paid in cash. The terms and conditions for the loans and the convertible notes shall be determined by the Board of Directors. As a consequence of the conversion of the convertible notes, the Board of Directors is authorized for the period ending 30 June 2026 to increase the Company's share capital by a nominal value of up to DKK 78,854,850 (7,885,485 shares of DKK 10 each) in one or more portions by resolution of the Board of Directors by conversion of the convertible notes and on such other terms as the Board of Directors may determine. The Company’s existing shareholders shall not have pre-emption right to subscribe for shares issued by conversion of the convertible notes. The new shares issued based on convertible notes shall have the same rights as existing shares according to the Articles of Association. The new shares shall be negotiable instruments, shall be registered in the names of the holders and shall be entered in the Company's register of shareholders. No restrictions shall apply to the transferability of the new shares, and no shareholder shall be obliged to have his shares redeemed - in whole or in part. The new shares shall carry the right to dividend from the time of conversion of the issued convertible notes, i.e. from the time of subscription.” Re 8c) Proposal to authorize the Board of Directors to issue warrants The Board of Directors proposes to authorize the Board of Directors so that the Board of Directors until 31 December 2026 is authorized to issue warrants, which entitle the holders to subscribe for shares in the Company at a nominal value of up to DKK 20,000,000 (identical to nominally DKK 20,000,000 last year). The Board of Directors also proposes to authorize the Board of Directors to reuse or reissue any lapsed and unexercised warrants under the terms and within the time limitations set out in this authorization. The proposal entails authorizing the Board of Directors to increase the share capital of the Company as a consequence of the issuance of warrants until 1 April 2030. Consequently, amending Article 5b to the Articles of Association as follows: ""During the period ending 31 December 2026, the Company may issue warrants, in one or more portions by resolution of the Board of Directors. The warrants may be issued to employees of the Company or its subsidiaries for the subscription of a nominal value of up to DKK 20,000,000 (2,000,000 shares of DKK 10 each), however, the number of shares may be higher or lower due to subsequent adjustments of the warrants in accordance with the adjustment clauses determined by the Board of Directors when the warrants are issued. The warrants can be exercised by cash contribution at a subscription price and on such other terms as the Board of Directors may determine. Warrants may not be granted to members of the management or to members of the Company's Board of Directors (except for employee representatives (if such may have been elected) who receive warrants in their capacity as employees of the Company or of the Company's subsidiaries). Holders of warrants shall have pre-emption right to subscribe for the shares issued based on the warrants, meaning that the pre-emption rights to subscribe to warrants and new shares for existing shareholders are deviated from. As a consequence of the exercise of awarded warrants, the Board of Directors is authorized during the period until 1 April 2030 to increase the share capital by a nominal value of up to DKK 20,000,000 (2,000,000 shares of DKK 10 each) in one or more portions by resolution of the Board of Directors by cash contribution at a subscription price and on such other terms as the Board of Directors may determine without pre-emption right for the existing shareholders, however, the number of shares by which the share capital may be increased may be higher or lower if the number of warrants is increased in accordance with the adjustment clauses determined by the Board of Directors when the warrants are issued. The new shares issued based on warrants shall have the same rights as existing shares according to the Articles of Association. The new shares shall be negotiable instruments, shall be registered in the names of the holders and shall be entered in the Company's register of shareholders. No restrictions shall apply to the transferability of the new shares and no shareholder shall be obliged to have his shares redeemed - in whole or in part. The new shares shall carry the right to dividend from the time of subscription. Subject to the rules in force at any time, the Board of Directors may reuse or reissue lapsed and unexercised warrants if any, provided that the reuse or reissue occurs under the terms and within the time limitations set out in this authorization. Reuse is to be construed as the Board of Directors' entitlement to let another party enter into an existing agreement on warrants. Reissue is to be construed as the Board of Directors' option to reissue new warrants, under the same authorization, if previously issued warrants have lapsed."" Re 8d) Proposal to approve the Remuneration PolicyThe Board of Directors proposes to amend the Remuneration Policy to update the remuneration of the Board of Directors, to reflect that Executive Management cannot be granted warrants as part of their (share-based) remuneration and additionally to reflect that a three-year performance period shall apply to the grant of Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) as part of the long-term incentive program for Executive Management (including thereto necessary consequential amendments). The Remuneration Policy must be submitted for approval in its entirety by the Company’s shareholders at least every fourth year. The Board proposes that the Remuneration Policy is approved in its entirety. The Remuneration Policy was last approved in its entirety at the general meeting in 2024. The Remuneration Policy can be downloaded from www.bavarian-nordic.com/agm. Re 8e) Proposal to approve remuneration of the Board of Directors and the Board Committees for the current financial yearThe Board of Directors proposes to update the remuneration for the Board of Directors for the financial year 2025 as set out below: (i) The annual base fee to members of the Board of Directors will be DKK 317,000 (previously DKK 300,000); (ii) the remuneration to the Chair will be three times (3.0) (same as last year) the annual base fee, equivalent to DKK 951,000; and (iii) the remuneration to the Deputy Chair will be two times (2.0) (previously 1.8 times) the annual base fee, equivalent to DKK 634,000. As in previous years, the Board of Directors proposes that, in addition to the base fee, members of the Board as part of their remuneration receives RSUs equal to 50% of the annual base fee of DKK 317,000 (for the Chair, however, equivalent to 50% of three times (3.0) the annual base fee and for the Deputy Chair equivalent to 50% of two times (2.0) (previously 1.8 time) the base annual fee) in accordance with the Company’s Remuneration Policy. The Board of Directors further proposes that the members of the three board committees, in line with previous years, will receive an additional annual committee fee of DKK 120,000 (same as last year) for the Nomination and Compensation Committee, DKK 150,000 (previously DKK 120,000) for the Science, Technology and Investment Committee and DKK 200,000 (previously DKK 120,000) for the Finance, Risk and Audit Committee. Further, it is proposed that the Chairs of the board committees, in accordance with the Remuneration Policy, will receive a higher fee than the ordinary members, with the Chair of the Nomination and Compensation Committee receiving DKK 240,000 (same as last year), the Chair of the Science, Technology and Investment Committee receiving DKK 275,000 (previously DKK 240,000), and the Chair of the Finance, Risk and Audit Committee receiving DKK 375,000 (previously DKK 240,000). Finally, and as in previous years, the Board of Directors proposes that each member of the Board of Directors receives (i) an attendance fee of DKK 5,000 for each board and/or committee meeting he/she attends to, which in no event can exceed DKK 5,000 per day or (ii) for members of the Board of Directors, who travel overseas in order to participate, a fee of USD 5,000. Furthermore, the Company pays the travelling expenses incurred by the board members in connection with board- and/or committee meetings, and any social costs associated with the remuneration of the Board of Directors and the board committees (e.g. mandatory contributions to social security in other countries). Re 8f) Proposal to authorize the Board of Directors to purchase own shares on behalf of the CompanyThe Board of Directors proposes that the Board of Directors is authorized on behalf of the Company to acquire own shares in the Company. It is therefore proposed that the following authorization is granted to the Company’s Board of Directors pursuant to Article 198 of the Danish Companies Act: “The General Meeting hereby authorizes the Board of Directors to acquire own shares on behalf of the Company in accordance with Article 198 of the Danish Companies Act. The Company may only acquire own shares for a total nominal value of up to 10 % of the Company’s share capital for the time being. The remuneration paid in connection with the acquisition of own shares may not deviate by more than 10 % from the price of the Company's shares on Nasdaq Copenhagen at the time of acquisition. This authorization is granted to the Company’s Board of Directors for the period until 31 December 2026."" * * * * * * * * Majority requirementsAdoption of the proposals referred to in items 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8d, 8e, and 8f, requires a simple majority of votes.

Financial guidance 2025Zealand Pharma’s financial guidance on net operating expenses for 2025, published on February 20, 2025, is confirmed excluding transaction-related costs. About petrelintidePetrelintide is a long-acting amylin analog suitable for once-weekly subcutaneous administration that has been designed with chemical and physical stability with no fibrillation around neutral pH, allowing for co-formulation and co-administration with other peptides1. Amylin is produced in the pancreatic beta cells and co-secreted with insulin in response to ingested nutrients. Amylin receptor activation has been shown to reduce body weight by restoring sensitivity to the satiety hormone leptin2,3, inducing a sense of feeling full faster. Current clinical data or pre-clinical data suggest a potential of petrelintide to deliver weight loss comparable to GLP-1 receptor agonists but with improved tolerability for a better patient experience and high-quality weight loss. In a Phase 1b multiple ascending dose trial, petrelintide demonstrated body weight reductions of up to a mean of 8.6% after 16 weeks, versus 1.7% for the pooled placebo group. Petrelintide was well tolerated, with no serious or severe adverse events. All gastrointestinal adverse events were mild, except for two moderate events (nausea and vomiting) reported by one participant who discontinued treatment. No other participants discontinued treatment due to adverse events. No other events of vomiting occurred, and two events of diarrhea were reported, both of which were mild4. Petrelintide is being evaluated in Phase 2b clinical trials. ZUPREME-1 is for people with obesity/overweight without type 2 diabetes (T2D) and was initiated in December 2024 (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT06662539). ZUPREME-2 is for people with obesity/overweight with T2D and is expected to be initiated in the first half of 2025. About CT-388CT-388 is a once-weekly subcutaneous injectable, dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonist being developed for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). CT-388 was designed to have potent activity on both the GLP-1 and GIP receptors but with minimal to no ß-arrestin recruitment on either receptor. This biased signaling significantly minimizes receptor internalization and consequent desensitization, which is expected to lead to prolonged pharmacological activity. CT-388 is currently being studied in Phase 2b clinical trials in people with overweight/obesity with and without type 2 diabetes. About obesityObesity represents one of the greatest healthcare challenges of our time. Global prevalence of overweight and obesity is projected to reach ~50% by 20305. Obesity is a complex chronic disease associated with more than 220 complications and comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, liver disease, type 2 diabetes, kidney disease, neuro-inflammation, and some cancers6. Today, two once-weekly GLP-1RA-based therapies have been approved for weight management. There remains a substantial unmet medical need for more and better treatment options for the very large and heterogeneous population living with overweight and obesity. Important and urgent unmet medical needs include the need for treatments with alternative mechanisms of action, more tolerable treatments associated with less frequent and less severe gastrointestinal side effects for a better patient experience, treatments offering increased preservation of lean muscle mass, treatments with even better effect on obesity-related comorbidities, and treatments with even greater weight loss efficacy for the segment of people who need the most weight loss. Conference call and webcast informationZealand Pharma will host a conference call today, March 12, at 1:00 PM CET / 8:00 AM ET to elaborate on the collaboration and license agreement with Roche.

ZyVersa Therapeutics Highlights Data Demonstrating Inflammasome Inhibition Reduces Neuroinflammation and Pathological Brain Deposition of Amyloid Beta in Alzheimer’s Disease Mouse Model,"March 12, 2025 07:57 ET","WESTON, Fla., March  12, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ZyVersa Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: ZVSA, or “ZyVersa”), a clinical stage specialty biopharmaceutical company developing first-in-class drugs for treatment of inflammatory and renal diseases, highlights newly published data demonstrating that NLRP3 Inhibition attenuates development of AD pathology (buildup of Aβ) and neuroinflammation in a mouse model of AD, thereby attenuating disease progression. “These data strengthen support for the potential role for Inflammasome ASC Inhibitor as a treatment for Alzheimer’s and other neurological diseases, such as Parkinson’s disease,” said Stephen C. Glover, ZyVersa’s Co-founder, Chairman, CEO and President. “Data from our preclinical program demonstrate that IC 100 decreased inflammasome activation and ASC speck formation in the cortex of aging mice. A second study in postmortem brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease confirms that ASC expression correlates with Aβ and pTau in neurons. Labeled IC 100 associated with ASC in neurons in early stages of the disease thus offering potential as an imaging biomarker as well as a therapeutic option. Stay tuned for publication of data assessing the potential of IC 100 to block the damaging neuroinflammation that induces neural degeneration in Parkinson’s disease, which has been submitted to a peer reviewed journal and is currently under review.” The new study data were published in the peer-reviewed journal, Immunity. In the publication titled, NLRP3-mediated glutaminolysis controls microglial phagocytosis to promote Alzheimer’s disease progression, the researchers report data from studies conducted in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease, murine microglia, and human THP-1 cells. Key Findings The authors concluded, “Our data strengthen NLRP3 as a master-immune regulator and an important target in the treatment of AD and dementia, both through its control on previously described inflammatory pathway and via the (metabolic) mechanism we describe here, bringing hope to the development of improved therapies for patients with this devastating condition.” About Inflammasome ASC Inhibitor IC 100 IC 100 is a novel humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody that inhibits the inflammasome adaptor protein ASC. IC 100 was designed to attenuate both initiation and perpetuation of the inflammatory response. It does so by binding to a specific region of the ASC component of multiple types of inflammasomes, including NLRP1, NLRP2, NLRP3, NLRC4, AIM2, and Pyrin. Intracellularly, IC 100 binds to ASC monomers, inhibiting inflammasome formation, thereby blocking activation of IL-1β early in the inflammatory cascade. IC 100 also binds to ASC in ASC Specks, both intracellularly and extracellularly, further blocking activation of IL-1β and the perpetuation of the inflammatory response that is pathogenic in inflammatory diseases. Because active cytokines amplify adaptive immunity through various mechanisms, IC 100, by attenuating cytokine activation, also attenuates the adaptive immune response. The lead indication for IC 100 is obesity with certain metabolic complications. To review a white paper summarizing the mechanism of action and preclinical data for IC 100, Click Here. About ZyVersa Therapeutics, Inc. ZyVersa (Nasdaq: ZVSA) is a clinical stage specialty biopharmaceutical company leveraging advanced proprietary technologies to develop first-in-class drugs for patients with inflammatory or kidney diseases with high unmet medical needs. We are well positioned in the rapidly emerging inflammasome space with a highly differentiated monoclonal antibody, Inflammasome ASC Inhibitor IC 100, and in kidney disease with phase 2 Cholesterol Efflux Mediator™ VAR 200.

Upstream Bio Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Financial Results and Recent Business Highlights,"March 12, 2025 07:00 ET","– Completed enrollment of Phase 2 clinical trial of verekitug in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps; top-line data expected in the second half of 2025 – – Completed upsized IPO with gross proceeds of approximately $293 million, extending runway through 2027 – WALTHAM, Mass., March  12, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Upstream Bio, Inc. (Nasdaq: UPB), a clinical-stage company developing treatments for inflammatory diseases, with an initial focus on severe respiratory disorders, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2024, and provided a summary of recent business highlights. Upstream is developing verekitug, the only monoclonal antibody currently in clinical development that targets and inhibits the thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) receptor, in multiple severe respiratory diseases including chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP), severe asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). “We closed 2024 and started 2025 with strong continued momentum, marked by the successful completion of enrollment in our Phase 2 clinical trial of verekitug in patients with CRSwNP in January 2025. We expect to report top-line data from this trial in the second half of 2025, enabling regulatory discussions and preparations for a Phase 3 program in CRSwNP,” said Rand Sutherland, MD, Chief Executive Officer of Upstream. “We have also made significant progress developing verekitug in severe asthma and COPD,” Dr. Sutherland continued. “We remain on track to dose the first patient in our COPD program in the second half of 2025 and, as previously reported, we expect to report top-line data from our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial in severe asthma in the second half of 2026. Our recently completed initial public offering has provided us with sufficient capital to fund our planned operations through 2027, supporting our strategy of leveraging verekitug's unique mechanism of action to improve treatment options for patients living with severe inflammatory diseases.” Fourth Quarter 2024 and Recent Business Highlights Fourth Quarter 2024 Financial Results As of December 31, 2024, Upstream had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $470.5 million, which is expected to fund planned operations through 2027. Research and development expenses were $21.8 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2024, compared to $11.6 million for the same period in 2023. The increase of $10.2 million was primarily driven by an increase in clinical and manufacturing expenses related to our verekitug program. General and administrative expenses were $5.2 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2024, compared to $3.2 million for the same period in 2023. The increase of $2.0 million was primarily driven by an increase in personnel-related expenses, including share-based compensation and insurance costs. Net loss was $21.2 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2024, compared to a net loss of $11.8 million for the same period in 2023. The increase of $9.4 million was largely due to increased research and development and general and administrative expenses, partially offset by increased interest income.

Contacts Trista Morrison, NACD.DC, tmorrison@vygr.com Media: Brooke Shenkin, brooke@scientpr.com  GAAP vs. Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresVoyager’s financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP, and represent revenue and expenses as reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Voyager has provided in this release certain financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with GAAP, including net collaboration revenue and net research and development expenses, which exclude the impact of reimbursement by Neurocrine Biosciences (Neurocrine) and Novartis Pharma AG (Novartis) for expenses we incur in conducting preclinical development activities under our collaboration agreements. Management uses these non-GAAP measures to evaluate the Company’s operating performance in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparison and analysis of trends in its business. Management believes that such non-GAAP measures are important in comparing current results with prior period results and are useful to investors and financial analysts in assessing the Company’s operating performance. Non-GAAP financial measures are not required to be uniformly applied, are not audited and should not be considered in isolation. The non-GAAP measures give investors and financial analysts a better understanding of our net revenue and net research and development expenses without the pass-through impact of Neurocrine costs. The non-GAAP financial information presented here should be considered in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for, the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures set forth below. Note 1: Under the Company's existing collaboration agreements with Neurocrine and Novartis, Neurocrine and Novartis have agreed to be responsible for all costs the Company incurs in conducting preclinical development activities for certain collaboration programs, in accordance with joint steering committee agreed upon workplans and budgets. Reimbursable research and development services performed during the period are captured within collaboration revenue and research and development expenses in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. During the three months ended December 31, 2024, we incurred $1.9 million of reimbursable research and development services recorded within collaboration revenue and research and development expenses. During the three months ended December 31, 2023, we incurred $3.1 million of reimbursable research and development services recorded within collaboration revenue and research and development expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we incurred $8.5 million of reimbursable research and development services recorded within collaboration revenue and research and development expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we incurred $10.1 million of reimbursable research and development services recorded within collaboration revenue and research and development expenses.",https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/03/11/3040977/36461/en/Voyager-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2024-Financial-and-Operating-Results.html

Mural Oncology Announces Fourth Quarter and Year End 2024 Financial Results and Highlights Upcoming Clinical Milestones,"March 11, 2025 16:01 ET","Interim analysis of overall survival in potentially registrational phase 3 ARTISTRY-7 trial in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer expected in late Q1/early Q2 2025 Top-line data readout of potentially registrational phase 2 ARTISTRY-6 (cohort 2) trial in mucosal melanoma expected in Q2 2025 Preliminary data readouts for less-frequent intravenous dosing of nemvaleukin alfa in the ARTISTRY-6 trial in patients with cutaneous melanoma expected in 1H 2025 for monotherapy (cohort 3) and 2H 2025 for combination therapy (cohort 4) Cash runway extended into Q1 2026 through operational efficiencies WALTHAM, Mass. and DUBLIN, March  11, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mural Oncology plc (Nasdaq: MURA), a clinical-stage immuno-oncology company developing novel, investigational engineered therapies targeting cytokine pathways designed to address areas of unmet need for patients with a variety of cancers, today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2024 and provided a business update. “By prioritizing operational efficiency and execution in 2024, we delivered on our milestones and positioned ourselves for a pivotal 2025, with several key inflection points anticipated for our nemvaleukin program. Late this quarter or early next quarter, we will report the interim overall survival analysis for ARTISTRY-7, a potentially registrational trial in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. As is typical for interim analyses, the bar for success is high. We believe that either declaring the trial complete at the interim analysis or deciding to progress the trial to a final analysis based on the available overall survival data would be a meaningful step forward both for patients and for Mural. Additionally, topline data from ARTISTRY-6 in mucosal melanoma, expected in the second quarter of 2025, represents another potentially significant opportunity for impact and value creation,” said Caroline Loew, Ph.D., CEO of Mural Oncology. Recent Corporate Highlights In January 2025, Mural announced that, consistent with the company’s prior timing projections, the phase 3 ARTISTRY-7 trial reached the 75% of overall survival (OS) events necessary for the planned interim analysis. This data remains blinded to the company until after the independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) has reviewed the interim analysis, which is expected to be in late Q1/early Q2 2025. In January 2025, the company also announced that patient enrollment in cohort 3 of the phase 2 ARTISTRY-6 trial is now complete. Mural expanded its pipeline in Q4 2024 by nominating two development candidates: Upcoming Milestones Late Q1/early Q2 2025: Interim data readout of ARTISTRY-7 ARTISTRY-7 is a potentially registrational phase 3 trial evaluating nemvaleukin alfa in combination with pembrolizumab versus investigator’s choice single agent chemotherapy in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (PROC). Consistent with interim analyses, there is a higher statistical bar for success at the interim analysis compared to the final analysis. If the hazard ratio at the interim analysis meets this pre-specified higher bar for success at the interim analysis (0.727, or a 27.3% reduction in the risk of death assuming exactly 215 OS events), the company plans to submit a Biologics License Application (BLA) for nemvaleukin in combination with pembrolizumab for the treatment of PROC in 2025. If the hazard ratio does not meet the statistical threshold for success at the interim analysis and the company deems the study to have a high probability of success at the final analysis, Mural expects to continue the trial to the protocol-specified final OS. At the final OS analysis, the maximum hazard ratio for success is 0.788, or a 21.2% reduction in the risk of death, assuming exactly 286 events. In that scenario, the company expects to report final OS result in the second quarter of 2026, subject to event accrual. Q2 2025: Top-line data readout of ARTISTRY-6, Cohort 2 ARTISTRY-6, cohort 2 is a potentially registrational phase 2 trial of nemvaleukin monotherapy in patients with unresectable or metastatic mucosal melanoma previously treated with immune checkpoint blockade. Nemvaleukin has been granted Orphan Drug Designation by the United States Food & Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of mucosal melanoma. The target response rate in the ARTISTRY-6 trial is 25%. Mural believes that in this rare and highly aggressive tumor, which has historically had poor outcomes even in the first line setting, demonstrating durable responses with a response rate of 20-25% would be meaningful for patients, and would support a discussion with the FDA regarding a BLA submission and potential accelerated approval. 1H 2025: Preliminary data readout of ARTISTRY-6, Cohort 3 This trial is an evaluation of less-frequent intravenous (LFIV) dosing of nemvaleukin monotherapy in patients with cutaneous melanoma. The company is conducting the trial to evaluate the activity and further characterize the safety of nemvaleukin with LFIV dosing in patients with cutaneous melanoma. 2H 2025: Preliminary data readout of ARTISTRY-6, Cohort 4 This trial is an evaluation of LFIV dosing of nemvaleukin in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with cutaneous melanoma. 1H 2026: Submission of Investigational New Drug or Clinical Trial Application for a phase 1 trial of MURA-8518 MURA-8518 is Mural’s IL-18 development candidate. Native IL-18 is a potent immune-stimulating cytokine, but its activity is blunted by IL-18BP, a high affinity decoy protein that neutralizes IL-18, thereby rendering it ineffective. The native cytokine’s potency is also limited by its short half-life. MURA-8518 aims to address these shortcomings in two ways. First, through the introduction of mutations designed to minimally impact the native structure while eliminating binding to IL-18BP. Secondly, half-life extension via fusion to a protein scaffold increases the cytokine’s exposure, allowing for sustained immune stimulation. Together, these have demonstrated more durable immunological effects in preclinical studies. Financial Results for the Quarter Ended December 31, 2024 Cash Position: As of December 31, 2024, cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $144.4 million. R&D Expenses: Research and development expenses were $28.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to $42.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in employee-related expenses, including a non-cash share-based employee compensation charge in the fourth quarter of 2023 as a result of the impact of the modification of our share based-awards in connection with the separation from Alkermes plc (“Alkermes”), our former parent. In addition, the timing of patient enrollment in the ARTISTRY-7 trial, as well as the winding down of the ARTISTRY-1 and ARTISTRY-2 trials during 2024 also contributed to the decrease in R&D expenses in the fourth quarter of 2024, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. G&A Expenses: General and administrative expenses were $7.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to $16.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. This decrease in G&A expenses was primarily due to a decrease in employee-related expenses compared to those previously allocated to us by Alkermes prior to the separation and to one-time increases in employee related expenses in 2023, including a non-cash share-based employee compensation charge in the fourth quarter of 2023 as a result of the impact of the modification of our share based-awards in connection with the separation. Net Loss: Net loss was $34.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to $59.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. The net loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 included $11.7 million resulting from one-time charges related to the separation from Alkermes and conversion of Alkermes employee equity awards into Mural equity. Financial Guidance: Mural’s cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of December 31, 2024 are expected to fund its operations into the first quarter of 2026. About Mural Oncology Mural Oncology is leveraging its novel protein engineering platform to develop cytokine-based immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer. By combining our expertise in cytokine biology and immune cell modulation and our protein engineering platform, we are developing medicines to deliver meaningful and clinical benefits to people living with cancer. Our mission is to broaden the potential, and reach, of cytokine-based immunotherapies to improve the lives of patients. Our lead candidate, nemvaleukin alfa, is currently in potentially registrational trials in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer and mucosal melanoma reading out in the first half of 2025. Mural Oncology has its registered office in Dublin, Ireland, and its primary facilities in Waltham, Mass. For more information, visit Mural Oncology’s website at www.muraloncology.com and follow us on LinkedIn and X. About Nemvaleukin Nemvaleukin alfa (nemvaleukin) is an engineered fusion protein designed to leverage IL-2’s antitumor effects while mitigating the hallmark toxicities that limit its use. Nemvaleukin selectively binds to the intermediate-affinity IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) and is sterically occluded from binding to the high-affinity IL-2R. Because of this molecular design, nemvaleukin treatment leads to preferential expansion of antitumor CD8+ T cells and natural killer cells, with minimal expansion of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells. Nemvaleukin is currently being evaluated in two potentially registrational late-stage trials: ARTISTRY-7 in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, with an interim data readout expected in late Q1/early Q2 2025 and final OS results projected in Q2 2026, and ARTISTRY-6, Cohort 2 in mucosal melanoma, with a topline readout in Q2 2025. About MURA-8518 IL-18 is a potent immune-stimulating cytokine, but its activity is blunted by IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP), a high affinity decoy protein that neutralizes IL-18, thereby rendering it ineffective. Native IL-18’s potency is also limited by its short half-life. MURA-8518 aims to address the shortcomings of native IL-18 in two ways. First, through the introduction of mutations designed to minimally impact the native structure while eliminating binding to IL-18BP. Secondly, half-life extension via fusion to a protein scaffold increases the cytokine’s exposure, allowing for sustained immune stimulation. Together, these have demonstrated more durable immunological effects in preclinical studies. Mural expects to submit an Investigational New Drug or a Clinical Trial Application for a phase 1 trial of MURA-8518 in the first half of 2026. About MURA-7012 Native IL-12 is a highly potent pro-inflammatory cytokine that has a narrow therapeutic index when administered systemically. To mitigate this toxicity, Mural, through its novel approach to protein engineering, split the IL-12p70 heterodimer into two inactive monomers: IL12p35 and IL-12p40. These individual subunits are then separately fused to antibody fragments and sequentially injected, which deliver and concentrate IL-12 preferentially in the tumor microenvironment to limit systemic exposure. In preclinical studies, MURA-7012, Mural’s engineered IL-12, achieved the desired reduction in serum while maintaining tumor concentrations providing the potential to reduce systemic toxicities.

Prime Biome promotes a balanced microbiome and contributes to overall oral hygiene, underscoring the importance of gut health in achieving a healthy smile. This additional benefit makes Prime Biome even more compelling for those looking to improve their health. The Role of Gut Health in Dental and Oral Hygiene Gut health plays a crucial role in maintaining dental and oral hygiene.

Why Traditional Skincare Falls Short & How Prime Biome Bridges the Gap Traditional skincare products often focus solely on topical applications, neglecting the underlying issues contributing to skin aging and blemishes. Prime Biome bridges this gap by addressing the root causes of skin problems through gut health optimization. While topical products can hydrate and protect the skin, they cannot tackle the internal factors that lead to premature aging and inflammation. Understanding cellular turnover is crucial for maintaining skin health, and Prime Biome's internal approach effectively supports this process. By promoting gut health, Prime Biome helps to enhance skin vitality, making it a superior choice for those seeking long-term solutions to skin concerns. Understanding Cellular Turnover and Prime Biome's Role in Skin Health Cellular turnover is a key factor in maintaining youthful and healthy skin. Prime Biome supports this process by promoting a balanced gut microbiome, essential for nutrient absorption and skin function. By addressing gut health, Prime Biome enhances the body's ability to regenerate skin cells, leading to a more transparent and radiant complexion. This internal approach sets Prime Biome apart from traditional skincare products, which often focus on superficial solutions. By tackling the root causes of skin issues, Prime Biome provides a comprehensive solution that supports long-term skin health. Get insights from leading studies on the role of gut microbiota in healthy aging Why Skincare Alone Can't Address the Root Cause of Aging While topical skincare products are essential for maintaining skin hydration and protection, they often fail to address the root causes of aging. Factors such as gut health, inflammation, and nutrient absorption play significant roles in skin vitality, and Prime Biome effectively targets these underlying issues. By focusing on gut health, Prime Biome provides a holistic solution that traditional skincare cannot achieve alone.

Medera Completes Patient Dosing in Phase 1/2a MUSIC-HFrEF Trial of SRD-001 Gene Therapy for Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction,"March 11, 2025 09:09 ET","BOSTON, March  11, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Medera Inc. (“Medera”), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on targeting difficult-to-treat and currently incurable diseases by developing a range of next-generation therapeutics, today announced that patient dosing has been completed in its MUSIC-HFrEF Phase 1/2a clinical trial of the gene therapy candidate SRD-001 in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HErEF). HErEF is a prevalent form of heart disease that accounts for half of an estimated 64.3 million heart failure cases worldwide and is currently considered a mass market incurable disease. The MUSIC-HFrEF trial is an open-label, uncontrolled study investigating SRD-001 across two cohorts with six patients dosed with SRD-001 in Cohort A (low-dose 3x1013 vg per patient) and three patients dosed in Cohort B (high-dose 4.5x1013 vg per patient). Preliminary data was presented at the 7th Annual Meeting of the American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy (ASGCT) in May 2024 on a subset of the patients dosed. The data showed an acceptable safety profile in patients with advanced heart failure and further demonstrated clinically meaningful improvements in multiple metrics of heart function and patient heath at six and 12 months post infusion. Topline data with 12-month follow-up will be reported in due course. ""The completion of enrollment in the Phase 1/2a trial marks a crucial milestone for this cardiac gene therapy trial in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). We are encouraged that this therapy may help patients with advanced heart failure who have few therapeutic options,"" said Brian Jaski, M.D., the Principal Investigator of MUSIC-HFrEF and Director of Cardiology at San Diego Cardiac Center. ""We are very excited and encouraged by these results, which indicate that our various new designs such as optimized dosages seem to be making differences,” said Ronald Li, Ph.D., CEO and co-founder of Medera. For more information on the MUSIC-HFrEF trial, please visit clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04703842. On September 5, 2024, Medera and Keen Vision Acquisition Corporation (“KVAC”) (NASDAQ:KVAC, KVACW), announced they had entered into a definitive merger agreement (the “Merger Agreement”). About SRD-001 SRD-001 is an investigational gene therapy candidate that contains an adeno-associated virus serotype 1 (AAV1) vector expressing the transgene for sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase 2a isoform (SERCA2a), in anti-AAV1 neutralizing antibody (NAb) negative subjects with ischemic or non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III/IV symptoms of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). About Heart Failure with reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF) HErEF is a complex cardiovascular pathophysiological syndrome that impairs normal cardiac function and results in the inability of the heart to pump a sufficient supply of blood to meet the body demand. Once established, HFrEF is generally progressive, irreversible, associated with debilitating symptoms, frequent re-hospitalizations and high mortality rates. An urgent need exists for disease modifying therapies, such as SRD-001, which aim to reverse the pathophysiology of HFrEF. About Medera Medera is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on targeting difficult-to-treat and currently incurable diseases by developing a range of next-generation therapeutics. Medera operates via its two preclinical and clinical business units, Novoheart and Sardocor, respectively.

Purespring Therapeutics appoints Haseeb Ahmad as Chief Executive Officer,"March 12, 2025 03:00 ET","London – 12 March 2025 - Purespring Therapeutics, a pioneering company focused on transforming the treatment of kidney diseases, today announces the appointment of Haseeb Ahmad as its Chief Executive Officer and member of the Board of Directors effective immediately. Haseeb has been appointed to steer Purespring through a critical phase of development and growth. He brings significant senior industry leadership, joining Purespring with over 25 years in the life science industry and an impressive track record of leading organisations to create blockbuster brands from primary care to rare diseases, across both mature and growth markets. Haseeb served most recently as President of Novartis Europe where he oversaw $15 billion in revenue across 53 markets. Prior to this, he led Novartis Gene Therapies to bring first-class, potentially curative gene therapies to patients, including Zolgensma, the first blockbuster gene therapy worldwide. Previously Haseeb held numerous global and in country leadership roles at Novartis and Merck & Co. (MSD). Haseeb succeeds Julian Hanak, who has served as CEO since December 2022 and previous to that CDO since June 2021. John Tsai, Chairman of Purespring’s Board of Directors said: “Haseeb's leadership expertise and proven track record make him an ideal fit for Purespring as we embark on a pivotal phase of development. Following our successful Series B financing, we are poised to expand our clinical activities, address larger indications and explore potential new partnerships and we are delighted to have someone of Haseeb’s calibre on board. “On behalf of the Board, leadership team, and entire organisation, I want to express our sincere gratitude to Julian Hanak for his exceptional leadership and invaluable expertise over the past two years. Under his guidance, Purespring has successfully completed its Series B fundraising, securing the financial foundation necessary to advance our therapies into clinical development. Julian’s contributions have been instrumental in positioning the company for this critical next phase, and we wish him continued success in his future endeavours.” Haseeb Ahmad, Chief Executive Officer said: “As one of the most exciting companies in this field, Purespring is leading the way in applying gene therapy to address unmet needs in kidney care. I am inspired by the company’s commitment to delivering breakthrough therapies and look forward to collaborating with its talented team and Board to revolutionise kidney disease treatment. This role holds deep personal significance for me as it continues the legacy of my late father, a pioneering nephrologist. Joining Purespring feels like a natural extension of his work, providing an opportunity to contribute meaningfully to the advancement of kidney disease treatments”. Purespring is the first company to successfully treat kidney disease models by directly targeting the podocyte, a specialised cell implicated in approximately 60% of renal disease, through its proprietary adeno-associated viral (AAV) gene therapy platform. The Company has a strong pipeline of programmes in development addressing both rare and large kidney disease indications. Its lead programme PS-002, is targeted to enter Phase I/II development for IgA Nephropathy (IgAN), a common, chronic kidney disease primarily affecting young adults. Other assets include programmes targeting other complement mediated kidney diseases, a programme targeting nephrotic syndrome and an undisclosed glomerular kidney disease programme. Purespring’s platform technology allows working copies of genes to be delivered with high efficiency and specificity to podocytes, opening up a new and highly differentiated modality for disease modifying treatments to address a broad range of kidney diseases. Julian Hanak will continue with the company for a period of time to ensure a smooth handover and will officially step down from the Purespring Board of Directors on 31st May 2025. In October 2024, Purespring announced the completion of its £80/$105 million Series B oversubscribed financing led by Sofinnova Partners in collaboration with Gilde Healthcare, Forbion, British Patient Capital and founding investor Syncona. This was followed by the presentation of new preclinical data on IgAN at the American Society of Nephrology (ASN) Kidney Week congress in San Diego (abstract #SA-OR63).

ACTG Presents Data from Mpox Study STOMP at CROI,"March 12, 2025 11:30 ET","LOS ANGELES, March  12, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ACTG, a global clinical trials network focused on HIV and other infectious diseases, recently presented data demonstrating that tecovirimat did not improve mpox resolution. The results from STOMP (Study of Tecovirimat for Mpox, also known as A5418) were shared as the oral abstracts, “Tecovirimat is Safe but not Efficacious in People with Clade II Mpox” and “Host and Disease Factors Were Not Associated with the Resolution of Mpox in Participants Receiving Tecovirimat” at the 2025 Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI) in San Francisco, California. STOMP stopped enrolling participants in December 2024 after an interim analysis showed that the treatment did not reduce the time to lesion resolution or have an effect on pain among adults with mild to moderate clade II mpox and a low risk of developing severe disease. “The results from STOMP reinforce the value of randomized clinical trials during outbreaks of infectious diseases, like mpox,” said Past ACTG Chair Judith Currier M.D., M.Sc. “There was considerable hope that tecovirimat would be an effective mpox treatment and it was only through this rigorously designed trial that we were able to conclusively demonstrate that tecovirimat alone did not speed time to resolution of mpox.” STOMP was a phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of tecovirimat for the treatment of mpox. Tecovirimat (SIGA Technologies, Inc.) is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat smallpox, but prior to STOMP it was not yet known if it could effectively or safely treat mpox. STOMP was initiated in September 2022 in response to a global outbreak of mpox that was characterized by increased person-to-person transmission. Mpox continues to circulate in the United States and around the world and there are no therapies that have been shown to be effective. STOMP enrolled participants who had had symptoms of mpox for less than 14 days and randomized them to receive either tecovirimat (600 mg) or a placebo twice daily for 14 days. Participants with or at risk for severe disease, pregnant women, and children were enrolled in an open-label arm in which everyone received tecovirimat. Tecovirimat is Safe but Not Efficacious in People with Clade II MpoxToday’s presentation, which was highlighted in a CROI press conference, found that tecovirimat did not reduce the time to clinical resolution of mpox lesions or improve pain control among adults with clade II mpox. There were no safety concerns and no deaths in either arm. STOMP randomized 412 eligible participants to tecovirimat (275) and placebo (137) at 50 sites in seven countries. Among those participants, 24 percent were enrolled remotely, 98 percent were male, 53 percent were White, 11 percent were Black, and 45 percent were Hispanic. 33 percent were living with HIV and 22 percent had received at least one dose of an mpox vaccine. “Importantly, STOMP showed that we can quickly design and execute international clinical trials in the face of an ongoing pandemic,” said Protocol Chair Timothy Wilkin, M.D., M.P.H., University of California San Diego. “It will be necessary, based on today’s results, to pursue alternative treatments for mpox and other orthopoxviruses.” Host and Disease Factors Were Not Associated with the Resolution of Mpox in Participants Receiving Tecovirimat This presentation analyzed a number of host and disease-related factors, including age, HIV status, vaccination status, and duration of symptoms, that might be associated with clinical mpox resolution and when mpox DNA was no longer detectable in skin lesions among the study participants who were enrolled in the open-label arm of STOMP. This analysis did not identify predictors of clinical mpox resolution and researchers suggested further investigation of this topic. While there were trends between younger age and lower levels of mpox DNA with faster clinical resolution, researchers found no significant associations in multivariate modeling (a statistical technique that determines the contributions of a number of factors to a singular outcome) with either clinical resolution or clearance of mpox DNA. “In the setting of public health emergencies, clinical trials like STOMP play an important role in not only evaluating treatments for safety and efficacy, but also potentially identifying key risk factors associated with worse outcomes,” said STOMP Vice Chair and Lead Author William Fischer, M.D., University of North Carolina. “The data presented here represent an important step forward in the evaluation of tecovirimat and in our understanding of mpox.” STOMP was led by Dr. Wilkin, Dr. Fischer, Jason Zucker, M.D., Columbia University (Vice Chair), and Dr. Currier. ACTG is led by Joseph J. Eron, M.D., UNC (ACTG Chair) and Rajesh T. Gandhi, M.D., Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School (ACTG Vice Chair). It is sponsored by the National Institutes of Health’s (NIH) National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID, which also funds ACTG) under award numbers UM1 AI068636, UM1 AI107716, and UM1 AI068634.

Globus Medical extends versatility of Advanced Materials Science™ anterior interbody portfolio with launch of COHERE™ ALIF Spacer and Modulus™ ALIF Blades,"March 11, 2025 16:40 ET","AUDUBON, Pa., March  11, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Globus Medical, Inc. (NYSE: GMED), a leading musculoskeletal technology company, today announced two commercial launches: The COHERE ™ ALIF Spacer is the latest addition to Globus Medical’s Advanced Materials Science™ (AMS) implant portfolio, featuring proprietary porous surface technology designed for bone in-growth while maintaining the imaging and mechanical properties favored in a solid PEEK interbody spacer.1,2 “Porous PEEK combines the stiffness and radiolucency of PEEK with the osseointegration potential offered by the porous technology,”1,3 said Frank Phillips, MD, professor of orthopedic surgery and fellowship director of the Division of Spine Surgery at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago. “The enhanced clinical outcomes possible with Cohere™ Porous PEEK for anterior cervical fusion4 and the comprehensive surface technology options available are now also helping to advance patient care for anterior lumbar spine surgery. In addition, the ability to radiographically assess fusion is a significant clinical benefit.” Modulus™ ALIF Blades extend the versatility of the Modulus™ ALIF Spacer portfolio by offering surgeons different fixation options with the same interbody spacer. Procedural efficiency is achieved with Modulus™ ALIF Blades through the ability to deliver anchoring blade fixation immediately following interbody spacer placement to reduce the number of surgical steps and instruments needed in the procedure. “Modulus™ ALIF with the anchoring blade option makes anterior spine surgery even more efficient while potentially reducing complications by reducing the number of instrument passes adjacent to major vessels,” said Anthony Kwon, MD, Orthopedic Spine Surgeon practicing at OrthoCarolina’s Spine Center and Atrium Medical Center in Charlotte, NC. “The low-profile instrumentation and streamlined delivery of fixation also helps to reduce the exposure window traditionally needed for anterior surgery, allowing for a more minimally invasive approach”. These two new offerings strengthen Globus Medical’s comprehensive anterior spine portfolio, designed to address a variety of the most challenging procedures in spine surgery. The integration of a Porous PEEK interbody spacer option and Modulus anchor fixation demonstrate Globus Medical’s commitment to providing surgeon partners with procedurally integrated ALIF solutions. “These products underscore our commitment to advancing surgical outcomes and providing spine surgeons with best-in-class solutions that span varying patient anatomy and surgeon preference to provide the best possible care in their hands,” said David Hole, president of Spine at Globus Medical. “We remain dedicated to delivering innovation through our product development engine to solve the unmet clinical needs of our surgeon partners while helping to improve patient care.” About Globus Medical, Inc.Globus Medical, Inc. is a leading global musculoskeletal company dedicated to solving unmet clinical needs and changing lives.
